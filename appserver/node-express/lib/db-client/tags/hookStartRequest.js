// TODO In 8.0-1, CANNOT include parse* information with Node Client values
// call, thus we can't get tags constrained to current search qtext
// or typeahead text.
// Fixed in 8.0-2: https://github.com/marklogic/node-client-api/issues/155
//.DO NOT TRY THE BELOW TECHNIQUE AT HOME.
// The use of the hookStartRequest is not recommended. It is a temporary
// workaround for Samplestack 1.1.0, to be used only as long as compatibility
// with Node Client version 1.0.1 is required.
