# samplestack, Java-Spring Appserver

The implementation of samplestack that runs using 

* gradle as build tool
* Java as middle-tier development language
* Spring Boot as application framework
* MarkLogic as database tier

## Quickstart 

*To build and run in one step:*

Start with an out-of-the box MarkLogic server, installed and running.  By default, MarkLogic will be secured with username admin, password admin.  If you have already secured MarkLogic, you need to update gradle.properties with the admin credentials you used to secure it.

* `./gradlew appserver`    Runs assemble, dbLoad, and bootrun

*To build the app*

* `./gradlew assemble`   This command bootstraps the middle tier and builds the Java project
* `./gradlew dbLoad`    This command loads some sample data
* `./gradlew bootrun`       This command runs the middle tier and MarkLogic services
* See the sibling project in /browser for instructions on running the browser application

*To begin developing*

* `./gradlew test` This command runs unit tests

*To use with Eclipse*

See project wiki http://github.com/marklogic/samplestack-marklogic/wiki

### Endpoints

By default the middle-tier appserver will be running on port 8090
