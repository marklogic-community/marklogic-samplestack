  name: "Farewell to Baseball (Lou Gherig)",
  point: "Fans, for the past two weeks you **have** been reading about a bad break I **got**. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.\n\nI **have** been in ballparks for seventeen years and **have** never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans. Look at these grand men. Which of you wouldn’t consider it the highlight of his career just to associate with them for even one day?\n\nSure I’m lucky.\n\nWho wouldn’t consider it an honor to **have** known Jacob Ruppert? Also, the builder of baseball’s greatest empire, Ed Barrow? To **have** spent six years with that wonderful little fellow, Miller Huggins? Then to **have** spent the next nine years with that outstanding leader, that smart student of psychology, the best manager in baseball today, Joe McCarthy?\n\nSure I’m lucky.\n\nWhen the New York Giants, a team you would give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift - that’s **something**. When everybody down to the groundskeepers and those boys in white coats remember you with trophies -- that’s **something**. \n\nWhen you **have** a wonderful mother-in-law who takes sides with you in squabbles with her own daughter -- that’s **something**.\n\nWhen you **have** a father and a mother who work all their lives so you can **have** an education and build your body -- it’s a blessing.\n\nWhen you **have** a wife who has been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed -- that’s the finest I know.\n\nSo, I close in saying that I might **have** been given a bad break, but I've **got an awful lot to live for**.\n",
