  "body": "\n\nHey guys, quick question, I have this query, and I am trying to get the latest comment for each topic and then sort those results in descending order (therefore one comment per topic). I have what I think should work, but my join always messes my results up. Somehow, it seems to have sorted the end results properly, but has not taken the latest comment from each topic instead it seems to have just taken a random comment. If anyone has any ideas, would really appreciate any advice\n\n\tSELECT * FROM comments \n\tJOIN topic ON topic.topic_id=comments.topic_id \n\tWHERE topic.creator='admin' \n\tGROUP BY comments.topic_id \n\tORDER BY comments.time DESC\n\t\n\ntable comments is structured like   \n**id    time    user    message     topic_id**\n\n  \n\ntable topic is structured like   \n**topic_id  subject_id  topic_title     creator     timestamp   description**",
