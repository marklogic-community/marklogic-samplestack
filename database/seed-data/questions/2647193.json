  "body": "\n\nI'm writing several C programs for an embedded system where every bit of performance we can squeeze out will matter.  Part of that is accessing log files.  When determining if a file exists, is there any performance difference between using open / fopen, and stat ? I've been using stat on the assumption that it only has to do a quick check against the file system, whereas fopen would have to actually gain access to a file and manipulate internal data structures before returning.  Is there any merit to this ?",
