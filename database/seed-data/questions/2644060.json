  "body": "\n\nI'm trying to add plugins to my game and what I'm trying to implement is this:\n\n* Plugins will be either mine or 3rd party's so I would like a solution where crashing of the plugin would not mean crashing of the main application. \n\n* Methods of plugins are called very often (for example because of drawing of game objects).\n\nWhat I've found so far:\n\n* 1) [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/pluginsincsharp.aspx](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/pluginsincsharp.aspx) - simple concept that seems like it should work nicely. Since plugins are used in my game for every round I would suffice to add the Restart() method and if a plugin is no longer needed Unload() method + GC should take care of that.\n\n* 2) [http://mef.codeplex.com/Wikipage](http://mef.codeplex.com/Wikipage) - Managed Extensibility Framework - my program should work on .NET 3.5 and I don't want to add any other framework separately I want to write my plugin system myself. Therefore this solution is out of question. \n\n* 3) Microsoft provides: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.addin.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.addin.aspx) but according to a few articles I've read it is very complex.\n\n* 4) Different AppDomains for plugins. According to Marc Gravell ( [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/665668/usage-of-appdomain-in-c](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/665668/usage-of-appdomain-in-c) ) different AppDomains allow isolation. Unloading of plugins would be easy. What would the performance load be? I need to call methods of plugins very often (to draw objects for example).\n\n* Using Application Domains - [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yb506139.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yb506139.aspx)\n\n* [A few tutorials on java2s.com](http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/CSharp/0240__Assembly/0020__AppDomain.htm)\n\nCould you please comment on my findings? New approaches are also welcomed! Thanks!",
