Is there a way I can lock down the actions of the app on an ec2 instance to either that specific instance, or to all of the boxes that have the same IAM role?", "lastActivityDate":"2014-01-01T07:28:22.857", "title":"IAM policy to allow EC2 instance API access only to modify itself", "tags":["amazon-web-services", "amazon-ec2", "iam"], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201401", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
