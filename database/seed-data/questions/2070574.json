  "body": "\n\nI tried to iterate backwards with ruby using a Range and each. This way:\n\n\t(4..0).each do |i|\n\t  puts i\n\tend\n\t==> 4..0\n\t\n\nIteration through 0..4 writes the numbers. On the other Range r = 4..0 seems to be ok, r.first == 4, r.last == 0. Seems to be strange to me that the construct above does not produce the expected result. What is the a reason for that? What are the situations when this behaviour is reasonable?",
