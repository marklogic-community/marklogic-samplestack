  "body": "\n\nGrails tends to write out the URL for everything that uses its tags as /appName/whatever.  For instance, if I use the tag:\n\n\t<g:javascript library=\"jquery\"/>\n\t\n\nthe resulting tag is\n\n\t<script src=\"/appName/jquery/jquery.js\"></script>\n\t\n\nThis causes an issue with using ProxyPass with Apache/Tomcat.  All of my CSS, JS, Images and links have that /appName prefixed to them.\n\nIs there a way to work around this with ProxyPass or possibly a way for Grails to not prefix the appName to the front of all of my URL's?
