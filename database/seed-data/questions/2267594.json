  "body": "\n\nI want to run my Java app and for a given workload be able to see:\n* how many times a given function was called \n* how expensive each function call is in relative terms (i.e. how long each takes to execute)\n\nI know broadly where the bottle neck is in my application but I need a much more fine grained view in order to narrow it down.\n\nThanks\n\n**Edit** jvisualvm looks like the tool - it identified the problem in about 30 seconds. I just need to know what 'selftime' means in the context of a method profile. Thanks",
