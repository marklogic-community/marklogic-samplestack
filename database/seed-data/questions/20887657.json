In my AppDelegate I instantiate a ReaderDemoController, which comes from the Vfr Reader library but, when running on the device (an iPhone5), it keeps saying: \n\n\n\tWrapper type 'Hager.VfrReaderCoreBinding.ReaderDemoController' is missing its native ObjectiveC class 'ReaderDemoController'.\n\t\n\nWhich is strange since the Fat library contains i386, armv7, armv7s and arm64 libraries (done that using lipo). This is the LinkWith file content:\n\n\t[assembly: LinkWith (\"libVfrReaderCoreNative.a\", LinkTarget.Simulator | LinkTarget.ArmV7 | LinkTarget.ArmV7s, ForceLoad = true)]\n\t\n\nIn the ApiDefinition file this is the ReaderController interface:\n\n\t[BaseType (typeof (UIViewController))]\n\tpublic interface ReaderDemoController {\n\t}\n\t\n\nNothing really \"complicated\". Any idea of what could be the cause?\nThis is the binding solution: [solution zipped](http://upload.hager.com/upload/66d08a5ccf1a18ec0d558dcdddd0b27e/Hager.VfrReaderCoreBinding.zip)\n\nThis is also not working in the simulator. I get : \n\n\tCould not create an native instance of the type 'Hager.VfrReaderCoreBinding.ReaderDemoController': the native class hasn't been loaded.\n\t\n\nIt is possible to ignore this condition by setting MonoTouch.ObjCRuntime.Class.ThrowOnInitFailure to false.", "lastActivityDate":"2014-01-06T16:47:16.943", "title":"MonoTouch issues when binding ObjectiveC library", "tags":["objective-c", "monotouch"], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201401", "itemTally":0, "owner":{"displayName":"Fabien", "id":"668734"}}
