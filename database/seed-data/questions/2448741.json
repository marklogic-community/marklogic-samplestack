  "body": "\n\nI'm thinking of building a Click-Once application, and am trying to wrap my head around how to handle the whole connection string issue. The problem is the following:\n\nI want to use EF to get data directly from each client, thus requiring each client to have a connection string configured (this is not the issue). How do I deal with clients that are not on the same domain as the SQL Server being queried? In other words, if I tried to run my app from home as opposed to from work, what should my connection string look like? Would I need to configure my SQL Server differently to allow this scenario?\n\nThanks in advance!",
