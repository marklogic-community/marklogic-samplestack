  "body": "\n\nI have been working on a C# 4.0 WPF project and need to figure out how to databind a Boolean value.  I have a reference to my Application.Current object in a window.  My \"App\" object contains a boolean field called \"Downloaded\" that is true if the user has downloaded information from a web service.  I need to databind a textbox's IsEnabled field to this Downloaded value.  Any tips?  Here is what I have come up with so far.  (Any useful links to better learn WPF XAML are greatly appreciated!)\n\nC# code:\n\n\tclass MainWindow : Window\n\t{\n\t    private App MyApp = App.Current as App; \n\t}\n\t\n\nXAML:\n\n\t<TextBox ... IsEnabled=\"{Binding Source=MyApp, Path=Downloaded}\" />\n\t",
