  "body": "\n\nI am learning Servlets and JSP. I am wondering about the \"doGet\" and other methods that may be overidden. The \"doGet\" takes 2 params - HTTPServletRequest request, and HTTPServletResponse response. This is my question: The request and response objects are used within the method body but I do not see any object creation e.g. request = new HTTPServletRequest. Are these objects created elsewhere e.g. in the superclass? This is just a Java question really as I often wonder about this with Applets also, i.e. the Graphics g object is passed to the \"paint\" method but I don't see it's creation anywhere?\n\nGF",
