  "body": "\n\nFrom the [Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html) on debugging, I found that I can customize output to my log files using this simple method:\n\n\tlogger.debug \"Person attributes hash: #{@person.attributes.inspect}\"\n\t\n\nI decided use this to track how a variable changes and goes through flow control.\n\nI would like to be able to see the line number of my code where `logger#debug` method was called. Something like this:\n\n\tlogger.debug \"Person attributes hash: #{@person.attributes.inspect} from line #{LINE_NUMBER_VAR}\"\n\t",
