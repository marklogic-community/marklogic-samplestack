However I looked at the description of the RDA function in that package and I'm a little confused now:\n\nUsage given in R:\n\n\trda(x, y, xnew=NULL, ynew=NULL, prior=table(y)/length(y),alpha=seq(0, 0.99, len=10), delta=seq(0, 3, len=10), regularization=\"S\", genelist=FALSE, trace=FALSE)\n\t\n\nI'm not sure what do \"alpha\" and \"delta\" stand for in this case. I was taught that in RDA, there are two parameters \"lambda\" and \"sigma\", where lambda is a complexity parameter that\ndictates the balance between linear and quadratic discriminant analysis and sigma is another parameter to regularise the covariance matrix further. BOTH OF THEM ARE BETWEEN 0 AND 1.\n\nBut as for this \"rda\" function in R, the default values of delta is between 0 and 3 which confused me. \n\nCould anyone explain this for me please?
