  "body": "\n\nI am trying to build PyGTK on CentOS for a non-standard Python (2.6, vs the out-of-the-box 2.4). It requires that I first build pygobject. pygobject-2.18.0 fails at the configure step. The error messages is as follows:\n\n\tchecking for GLIB - version >= 2.14.0... no\n\t*** Could not run GLIB test program, checking why...\n\t*** The test program failed to compile or link. See the file config.log for the\n\t*** exact error that occured. This usually means GLIB is incorrectly installed.\n\tconfigure: error: maybe you want the pygobject-2-4 branch?\n\t\n\nI have downloaded, built and successfully installed glib.\n\nThe config.log file contains the following output:\n\n\tconftest.c:27:18: error: glib.h: No such file or directory\n\tconftest.c: In function 'main':\n\tconftest.c:33: error: 'glib_major_version' undeclared (first use in this function)\n\tconftest.c:33: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once\n\tconftest.c:33: error: for each function it appears in.)\n\tconftest.c:33: error: 'glib_minor_version' undeclared (first use in this function)\n\tconftest.c:33: error: 'glib_micro_version' undeclared (first use in this function)\n\tconfigure:13844: $? = 1\n\t\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?",
