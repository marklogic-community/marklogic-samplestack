  "body": "\n\nI have a `StatusBar` that I'd like to house a `TextBlock` docked to the left and a `ProgressBar` filling the remaining width. In all my other experiences with the WPF `ProgressBar`, it will fill its given container, however in this situation it doesn't auto-size at all, it just appears as a tiny circle. Setting its height and width manually work fine, but I'd like it to scale to the remaining width of the `StatusBar`.\n\nHere's my XAML for the `StatusBar`:\n\n\t<StatusBar DockPanel.Dock=\"Bottom\" Height=\"25\">\n\t    <StatusBarItem DockPanel.Dock=\"Left\">\n\t        <TextBlock x:Name=\"lblStatus\"  Margin=\"5,0,0,0\"/>\n\t    </StatusBarItem>\n\t    <StatusBarItem>\n\t        <ProgressBar x:Name=\"pgbStatus\" />\n\t    </StatusBarItem>\n\t</StatusBar>\n\t",
