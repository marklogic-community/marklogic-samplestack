  "body": "\n\nI've to be continuously editing a 1MB file, simulating a file system. I've to modify the directory of File Control Blocks, FAT, blocks, etc.\n\nProffesor recommended overwriting the file every time an update is made. 1MB shouldn't take minutes to do that, but I don't like this way.\n\nIs it a FileChannel the way to go here? Also, I understand that if I edit a [MappedByteBuffer](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/nio/MappedByteBuffer.html), the content of the mapped file region is also edited immediately? i.e. is reflexive mapped?\n\nThanks.",
