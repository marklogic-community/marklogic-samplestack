  "body": "\n\nI have an issue and *NO* it is not homework, it's just a programmer who has been away from SQL for a long time having to solve a problem. \n\nI have the following table:\n\n\tcreate table students(\n\t    studentid int identity(1,1), \n\t    [name] varchar(200), \n\t    [group] varchar(10), \n\t    grade numeric(9,2) \n\t)\n\tgo\n\t\n\nThe group is something arbitrary, assume it's the following \"Group A\", \"Group B\"... and so on.\n\nThe grade is on a scale of 0 - 100.\n\nIf there are 5 students in each group with grades randomly assigned, what is the best approach to getting the top 3 students (the top 80%) based on their grade? \n\nTo be more concrete if I had the following:\n\n\tRonald, Group A, 84.5\n\tGeorge H, Group A, 82.3\n\tBill, Group A, 92.0\n\tGeorge W, Group A, 45.5\n\tBarack, Group A, 85.0\n\t\n\nI'd get back **Ronald, Bill, and Barack**. I'd also need to do this over other groups. ",
