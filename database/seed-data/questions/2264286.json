  "body": "\n\nForgive the \"duplicate\" question. I'd like to see this solved in Emacs Lisp too, and if I just tagged it for both topics, I probably would have only gotten one answer.   The Emacs answer should be sufficiently different that it's probably worthwhile to have it.\n\nI want to teach myself Spanish and I've got several word lists like\nthe data show below.  How can I generate a quiz from the data that\nlooks like this?\n\n<pre>\namarillo?  [ ] blue    [ ] yellow  [ ] gray   [ ] pink\nazul?      [ ] red     [ ] blue    [ ] green  [ ] orange\n .\n .\n .\nverde?     [  ] purple [ ] gold   [ ] green   [ ] black\n</pre>\n\nThe idea is to randomly include the answer with 3 randomly chosen\nincorrect answers.  Ideally, the incorrect answers would not be too\nrepetitive.\n\n<pre>\namarillo|yellow\nazul|blue\nblanco|white\ndorado|golden\ngris|gray\nmarrón|brown\nnaranja|orange\nnegro|black\noro|gold\npúrpura|purple\nrojo|red\nrosa|pink\nverde|green\n</pre>",
