  "body": "\n\nI would like to know how to efficiently implement filesystem changes in java? Say I got a file in a folder and modify that file. I would like to be notified by java about this change as soon as possible(no frequently polling if possible.). \n\nBecause I think I could call [java.io.file.lastModified](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/File.html#lastModified%28%29) every few seconds but I don't like the sound of that solution at all. \n\n\talfred@alfred-laptop:~/testje$ java -version\n\tjava version \"1.6.0_18\"\n\tJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_18-b07)\n\tJava HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 16.0-b13, mixed mode)\n\t\n\nMany thanks,\nAlfred",
