  "body": "\n\nI was wondering can anyone point me to a good tutorial on how to construct a SDP message.\n\nI have read the basics and can construct and understand the parameters but I just cant seem to get it to work.\n\nI either get a not acceptable here reply or no reply at all, this is after I get 100 Trying and 180 ringing back.\n\nSo my SIP works but it doesn't like the SDP Data.\n\nIts currently constructed like this:\n\n\tString sdpData = \"v=0\\r\\n\"\n\t            + \"o=- 019078020 0\"\n\t            + \" IN IP4  sip.ciceronetworks.com\\r\\n\" + \"s=MySession\\r\\n\"\n\t            + \"c=IN IP4  sip.ciceronetworks.com\\r\\n\"\n\t            + \"t=0 0\\r\\n\" + \"m=audio 6002 RTP/AVP 0\\r\\n\"\n\t            + \"a=sendrecv\\r\\n\" + \"a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000\\r\\n\" + \"a=ptime:20\\r\\n\"+ \"a=fmtp:97 mode=20\\r\\n\";\n\t\n\t\n\t    byte[] contents = sdpData.getBytes(); \n\t\n\t    request.setContent(contents, contentTypeHeader); \n\t\n\nAnd while like that I get 100 trying then 180 ringing but when I accept the call on the other end I get nothing back at all, it seems to just crash, I also get \"Audio device Error\" on the pc client that I try ringing.\n\nAnyone any ideas?",
