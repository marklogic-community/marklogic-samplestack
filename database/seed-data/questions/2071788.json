  "body": "\n\nI'm having some problems with sending POST data to a PHP script with NSURLConnection. This is my code:\n\n\t    const char *bytes = [[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\"?>\\n<mydata>%@</mydata>\", data] UTF8String];\n\t\n\t    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://myurl.com/script.php\"];\n\t    NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:url];\n\t\n\t    [request setHTTPMethod:@\"POST\"];\n\t    [request setHTTPBody:[NSData dataWithBytes:bytes length:strlen(bytes)]];\n\t\n\t    NSURLResponse *response;\n\t    NSError *err;\n\t    NSData *responseData = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:request returningResponse:&response error:&err];\n\t    NSLog(@\"responseData: %@\", responseData);\n\t\n\nAnd my script.php is as simple as this:\n\n\t<?php\n\t    echo $_POST['mydata'];\n\t?>\n\t\n\nThis have worked for me in the past, but for some reason the output I get from `NSLog(@\"responseData: %@\", responseData);` now is just \"<>\" instead of \"theData\".\n\nProbably some lame mistake somewhere but I can't seem to find it? Any ideas?",
