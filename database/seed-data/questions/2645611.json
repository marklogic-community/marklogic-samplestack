  "body": "\n\nusers can sign up to my site and get a standard url (username.teamgeisthq.com) from where they can access their content. They can also get a cleaner domain name like www.username.nl (same as username.teamgeisthq.com) to access their information.\n\nGoogle tells me that it s bad to have 2 urls pointing to the same content. i still want the user to be able to use both domainnames but tell search engine that the main site is the www.username.nl.\n\nI know of the 3xx redirect codes and have been reading [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10) but I don't see what code I best use (I think 302).\n\nCan Rails output a redirect code?\n\nThanks",
