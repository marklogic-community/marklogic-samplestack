  "body": "\n\nOk, I have this thing working. Rollover the links and it changes the banner/pic. Fantastic. Question is this: How can I change the text from 1,2,3... to whatever I want? In addition, how can I apply background images, hover, and active treatments. In the example at [http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/pager5.html](http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/pager5.html), I am using the #nav a {blah, blah} to affect the yellow box and border, but when I add an image it does nothing. Furthermore the ability to change the text seems to be buried in the actual Cycle Plugin. Anyone know how to do this?\n\nHere is my code\n\njavascript:\n\n\t$('#slideshow').cycle({ \n\t    speed:      200,\n\t    timeout:    0, \n\t    pager:      '#tabs', \n\t    pagerEvent: 'mouseover' \n\t});\n\t\n\nCSS (image not showing thought)\n\n\t#tabs a {\n\t    border-style: none;\n\t    height: 47px;\n\t    width: 192px;\n\t    background-image: url(../images/tabback.png);\n\t    -moz-background-clip:border;\n\t    -moz-background-inline-policy:continuous;\n\t    -moz-background-origin:padding;\n\t    background: none no-repeat scroll 0 0;\n\t    text-decoration:none;\n\t}\n\t\n\nand the HTML is not that important but I am spitting out the nav links at @tabs.
