  "body": "\n\nI am currently trying to solve this problem in MySQL. I have MySQLdb installed. What is the best way to write a list in Python, e.g.\n\n\t[1, 2, -1, -2]\n\t\n\nto a column of a MySQL database table? I would like each consecutive entry of the list to be put into consecutive rows of a MySQL column. I can obviously run individual queries in a loop, but I was wondering if there is any better/faster way.\n\nI am also willing to experiment with different data storage techniques if this isn't possible using MySQLdb. I am working with lists that contain several million entries each, and need to read/write quickly to some form of persistent storage that can store these many different lists as columns.\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for your responses. After being led to search for execute many, I found [this link](http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Python/MySQL-Connectivity-With-Python/5/), which had a useful example of executemany().",
