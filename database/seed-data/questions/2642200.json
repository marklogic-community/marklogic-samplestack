  "body": "\n\nI'm using the will_paginate gem for my Rails project and it's working beautifully.  Unfortunately, on paginated result sets with a larger number of pages, the link section is too wide.  Instead of:\n\n`« Previous 1 2 … 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 … 18 19 Next »`\n\nI would like to show:  \n\n`« Previous 1 2 … 5 6 7 8 9 … 18 19 Next »`\n\nHow can I reduce the number of page links being rendered?  I looked at the will_paginate docs on github but couldn't find a solution.  \n\nThanks!\nMoe",
