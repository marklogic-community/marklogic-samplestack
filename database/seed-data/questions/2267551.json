  "body": "\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nI'm trying to do an Active Directory Explorer with Asynch. jQuery TreeView. In standard ASP.NEt it was fairly easy with builtin TreeView and some events in code-behind.\n\nThe problem is that I don't exactly know how can I pass different arguments depending on which treeview leaf is being expanded. Based on this example [http://view.jquery.com/trunk/plugins/treeview/demo/async.html](http://view.jquery.com/trunk/plugins/treeview/demo/async.html) I can see that there is a very simple if with PHP and the 'root' argument is passed on page load. \n\nEg. \n\nI have this tree:\n\n+A  \n\n+B  \n\n+C\n\nand i want to call MyController/MyAction/B when expanding B. Should I add some method in\n\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t    $(document).ready(function(){\n\t        $(\"#black\").treeview({\n\t            url: \"source.php\"\n\t                        toggle: do_something_here?\n\t        })\n\t    });\n\t    </script>\n\t\n\nI'm kinda stuck in here, so any help would be appreciated.",
