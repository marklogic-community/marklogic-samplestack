  "body": "\n\nIs is possible to create/use a regular expression pattern in ruby that is based on the value of a variable name?\n\nFor instance, we all know we can do the following with Ruby strings:\n\n\tstr = \"my string\"\n\tstr2 = \"This is #{str}\" # => \"This is my string\"\n\t\n\nI'd like to do the same thing with regular expressions:\n\n\tvar = \"Value\"\n\tstr = \"a test Value\"\n\tstr.gsub( /#{var}/, 'foo' ) # => \"a test foo\"\n\t\n\nObviously that doesn't work as listed, I only put it there as an example to show what I'd like to do.  I need to regexp match based on the value of a variable's content.",
