  "body": "\n\nMy Silverlight 4 app is hosted in ASP.NET MVC 2 web application. It works fine when I browse with Internet Explorer 8. However Google Chrome (version 5) cannot find ASP.NET controllers. Specifically, the following ASP.NET controller works both with Chrome and IE.\n\n\t//[OutputCache(NoStore = true, Duration = 0, VaryByParam = \"None\")]\n\tpublic ContentResult TestMe()\n\t{\n\t  ContentResult result = new ContentResult();\n\t  XElement response = new XElement(\"SvrResponse\", \n\t    new XElement(\"Data\", \"my data\"));\n\t  result.Content = response.ToString();\n\t  return result;\n\t}\n\t\n\nIf I uncomment [OutputCache] attribute then it works with IE but not with Chrome. Also, I use custom model binding with controllers, so if I write the following:\n\n\tpublic ContentResult TestMe(UserContext userContext)\n\t{\n\t  ...\n\t}\n\t\n\nit also works with IE, but again not with Chrome which gives me error message saying that resource was not found. Of course, I configured IIS 6 for handling all requests via aspnet_isapi.dll and I have registered custom model binder in my web app's Global.asax inside Application_Start() method.\nCan someone explain me what might be the cause? Thank you.",
