  "body": "\n\nI have a CALayer which its position needs to be recomputed as often as possible. I'm currently using a NSTimer for that matter, but I would prefer to hook myself into Core Animation directly.\n\nWhen you add an animation to a layer, the values are refreshed as often as possible without any timers. Is there any way to use this mechanism? I was thinking about rolling my own CAAnimation subclass, but that doesn't seem to be feasible.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",
