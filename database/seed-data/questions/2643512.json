This app starts the bottle webserver thanks to the subprocess module.\n\n\timport subprocess\n\tp = subprocess.Popen('python websrv.py')\n\t\n\nThe bottle app is quite simple\n\n\t@route(\"/\")\n\tdef index():\n\t    return template('index')\n\t\n\trun(reloader=True)\n\t\n\nIt starts the default webserver into a Windows console.\n\nAll seems Ok except the fact that I must press Ctrl-C to close the bottle webserver. I would like that the master app terminates the webserver when it shutdowns. I can't find a way to do that (p.terminate() doesn't work in this case unfortunately)\n\nAny idea?\n\nThanks in advance",
