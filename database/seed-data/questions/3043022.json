  "body": "\n\nApparently in IE8, there is this option 'Preserve Favorites website data', even if I uncheck it the browser will still keep the cookies until the last window is closed.\n\nProblem scenario. say I logged in to somesite.com, then without logging out, I closed the window, but there was still another IE8 window open. In this case IE8 will keep the cookies of this site. So If I opened the site again (same window or another) the site won't ask for login info.\n\nThe client wants the web application to be logged off as soon as the user closes the browser. Can I force delete the cookies IE8 is saving? or maybe I can stop the user from closing the window until I simulate a click on logout button?",
