  "body": "\n\nCurrently I have a DropDownList inside a FormView, databound to an ObjectDataSource. This is the DropDownList, which has it's own datasource, which returns a List of Departments:\n\n\t<asp:DropDownList ID=\"DepartmentsList\" DataSourceID=\"DepartmentsListDataSource\" DataTextField=\"Name\" SelectedValue='<%# Bind(\"Department\") %>' runat=\"server\" />\n\t\n\nIn the datasource of the FormView, the property Department is defined as:\n\n\tpublic Department Department { get; set; }\n\t\n\nWith this situation I get this exception:\n\n> 'DepartmentsList' has a SelectedValue which is invalid because it does not exist in the list of items.\n  Parameter name: value \n\nLogically I get this exception because I haven't set DataValueField on the DropDownList. Question is, what has to be the value of DataValueField if I'd like to databind the complete selected object (of Department) back to the FormViews datasource?\n\nThanks.",
