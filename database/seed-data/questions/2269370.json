  "body": "\n\nI'm trying to create a HTTP handler to handle all requests to a folder but I only want it to fire if the files requested don't exist (EG: Request comes in for file X, if X exists I'd like to serve the file, otherwise the handler should deal with it).\n\nThe files will only be static content, not scripts themselves, which I assume makes it a bit easier but I can't seem to find anything that will do the trick... Anyone have any ideas? I assume it can be done since the IIS7 rewrite module can manage it, but I can't see how...\n\n**Edit** Just to clarify... the handler is the typical case and it is not an error-handling routine but actually delivering appropriate content. I just want the ability to add new files to the folder either as separate things or as overloads to what the handler would deliver.",
