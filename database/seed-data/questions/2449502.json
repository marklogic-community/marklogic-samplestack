  "body": "\n\nI understand very well the need for websites' front ends to be coded and compressed as much as possible, however, I feel like I have more lax standards than others when it comes to practical applications.\n\nFor instance, while I understand why some would, I don't see anything wrong with putting selectors in the `<html>` or `<body>` tags on a website with an expected small visitation rate. I would only do this for a cheap website for a small client, because I can't really justify the cost of time otherwise.\n\nSo, that said, do you think it's okay to draw a line? Where do you draw yours?",
