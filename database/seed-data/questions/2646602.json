  "body": "\n\nThe function \"WriteStartElement\" does not return anything.  I find this a little bizzare.\nSo up until now I have been doing it like this.\n\n\tXmlDocument xmlDoc = new XmlDocument();\n\tXmlTextWriter xmlWriter = new XmlTextWriter(m_targetFilePath, System.Text.Encoding.UTF8);\n\txmlWriter.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;\n\txmlWriter.WriteProcessingInstruction(\"xml\", \"version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'\");\n\txmlWriter.WriteStartElement(\"client\");\n\txmlWriter.Close();\n\txmlDoc.Load(m_targetFilePath);\n\tXmlElement root = xmlDoc.DocumentElement;\n\t\n\nSaving the doc, then reloading it to get hold of the start element so i can write attributes to it.  Does anybody know the correct way of doing this because I'm pretty sure what I'm doing isn't right.\n\nI tried to use xmlWriter.AppendChild() but it doesnt seem to write out anything. :(",
