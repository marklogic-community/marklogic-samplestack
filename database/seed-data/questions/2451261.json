  "body": "\n\nI have a .Net 2 C# application I am developing which uses a VB 6 generated COM DLL. The VB DLL is updated frequently any my application crashes with a System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80040154).  The part of the COM DLL I use does not change but the version (and CLSID) will.\n\nThe \"Specific Version\" option for the reference is false. The WrapperTool is tlbimp.\n\nHow do I tell my application not to worry about changes in the DLL? Is there any way of checking just the functions I am using?",
