  "body": "\n\nI'm trying to create a function in Groovy that does the following:\n1. Accepts 2 parameters at runtime (a string of XML, and an xpath query)\n2. Returns the result as text\n\nThis is probably quite straightforward but for two obstacles:\n1. This has to be done in groovy\n2. I know next to nothing nothing about groovy or Javaâ€¦\n\nThis is as far as I've got by hacking various bits of code together, but now I'm stuck:\n\n\timport javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;\n\timport javax.xml.xpath.*;\n\t\n\tbuilder  = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder();\n\tdoc      = builder.parse(new ByteArrayInputStream(xml.bytes));\n\texpr     = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath().compile(expression);\n\tObject result = expr.evaluate(doc, XPathConstants.NODESET)\n\t\n\nwhere \"xml\" and \"expression\" are runtime parameters. How do I get this now to return the result (as a string)?\n\nThanks",
