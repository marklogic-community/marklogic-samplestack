  "body": "\n\nI have a div that has been given a tabindex, when the div is focused(click or tabbed to) it does the following:\n\ninserts an input into itself,\ngives the input focus\n\nthis works great in FF, IE and Opera\n\nbut in Chome/Safari it gives the input focus but fails to actually put the cursor inside the input (I know it gives it focus because the safari/chrome focus borders appear).\n\nAny suggestions as to what is going on?\n\nI have to fix the key handler after this so the arrow keys and backspace keys work too, feel free to chime in on that if you'd like.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nHere's a sample of the code:\n\n\tvar recipientDomElem = $(\"#recipientsDiv\");\n\trecipientDomElem[0].tabIndex = 0;\n\t$(\"#recipientsDiv\").focus(function(e){\n\tvar code = (e.keyCode ? e.keyCode : e.which);\n\twindow.clearTimeout(statusTimer);\n\trecipientDivHandler(code, null);\n\t});\n\t\n\t\n\tfunction recipientDivHandler(code, element){\n\t$(\"#recipientsDiv\").append('<input type=\"text\" id=\"toInput\" class=\"inlineBlockElement rightSpacer\" style=\"border:0px none #ffffff; padding:0px; width:40px;margin-bottom:3px;padding:0; overflow:hidden; font-size:11px;\" />');\n\t$(\"#toInput\").focus();\n\t}\n\t\n\nAnother oddity about this is that tabbing through to the div will fire the div.focus() function and correctly give the input focus...it's just the click that fails.  I tried putting a .click() function on the div to do the same as the focus, but it's not working.",
