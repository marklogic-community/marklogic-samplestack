  "body": "\n\nI have set up a Core Data model that includes an entity, `Item` with a 1->M relationship with the abstract entity `Place`, so that an item has many places. There are several entities with the parent set to `Place`.\n\nI want to set up several UI elements depending on the descendent place types. I have a loop that looks something like this:\n\n\tfor (Place *place in item.places) {\n\t\n\t}\n\t\n\n... but I'm not sure how to detect what type the place is, and how to cast it to the proper type so that I can access its properties.\n\nThanks for any help!",
