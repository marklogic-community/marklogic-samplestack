  "body": "\n\nIs there anyway to change the coordinates of some of the points within a GraphicsPath object while leaving the other points where they are?\n\nThe GraphicsPath object that gets passed into my method will contain a mixture of polygons and lines.  My method would want to look something like:\n\n\tvoid UpdateGraphicsPath(GraphicsPath gPath, RectangleF regionToBeChanged, PointF delta)\n\t{\n\t    // Find the points in gPath that are inside regionToBeChanged\n\t    // and move them by delta.\n\t    // gPath.PathPoints[i].X += delta.X; // Compiles but doesn't work\n\t}\n\t\n\nGraphicsPath.PathPoints seems to be readonly, so does GraphicsPath.PathData.Points.  So I am wondering if this is even possible.\n\nPerhaps generating a new GraphicsPath object with an updated set of points?  How can I know if a point is part of a line or a polygon?\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions then I would be grateful.",
