  "body": "\n\nWhenever i hear about interfaces i have the following doubt.\n\ni have the following interface \n\n\tinterface Imammals\n\t          {\n\t           walk();\n\t           eat();\n\t           run();\n\t          }\n\t\n\nand i have two classes **Human** and **Cat** that implements this interface.\n\nAnyway, the functionality of the methods are going to be different in both the Classes. \n\n**For Eg:** walk(), the functionality differs as cat uses four legs and human uses two legs\n\nThen, Why do i need to have a common interface which ONLY declares these methods? Is my design here faulty?\n\nIf the functionality of the methods are going to be same in both the classes, i could go for a class based inheritance where the parent implements the complete functionality and the child inherits and uses the parent class methods.\n\nBut here the interfaces help us just to consolidate the methods declarations or is there anything more inside?\n\n**EDIT:** walking(), eating(), running() was changed to walk(), eat(), run() and mammals was changes to Imammals.",
