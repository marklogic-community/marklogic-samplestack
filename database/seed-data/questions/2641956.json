Say if user logs in as an English user it shows Client Name, Order Number... and if user logs in as a Polish user it shows Nazwa klienta, Numer zam√≥wienia instead? \n\nI only know the hardcoded one like below:\n\n\t        <System_Collections_Generic:List`1 x:Key=\"columnNameList\">\n\t            <System:String>Client Name</System:String>\n\t            <System:String>Order Number</System:String>\n\t            <System:String>Date</System:String>\n\t        </System_Collections_Generic:List`1>\n\t",
