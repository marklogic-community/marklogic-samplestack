  "body": "\n\nThis new language called Vala, which is said to be C#-like and supposedly easier than C++ or C, compiles down into C on Linux with the GCC compiler.\n\nSounds great. Now I want to use it to make a PHP extension module so that slow PHP code can be made in Vala and imported into PHP as a function.\n\nHow do I accomplish this in Vala? Is it even possible?",
