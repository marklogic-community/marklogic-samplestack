  "body": "\n\nI have a UIScrollView. \nIn there I add buttons programmatically. \nRight now I just use UIButton and set one title. But I need to have an UIImage View in there, that will change upon certain events, Text that will change too etc. and I would like to style that in Interface Builder, but I can't figure out how to do this. Which class should I extend, and what kind of xib should I create and what in there, so that in the end I can make the right connections and so that I can listen for UIControlEventTouchDown of that Button.",
