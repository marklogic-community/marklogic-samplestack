  "body": "\n\nOkay, I tried searching around, but couldn't come up with a decent idea on what to query on, so I figured I'd post a question.  How can I pull back master/detail information without having the master data duplicated along with every line of detail data?\n\nGiven the following scenario:\n\n\tMaster - Cars\n\t=============\n\tdecimal  car_id (pk)\n\tstring   name\n\tdecimal  cost\n\tdecimal  doors\n\t\n\tChild - Colors\n\t=============\n\tdecimal color_id (pk)\n\tdecimal car_id (fk)\n\tstring  color\n\t\n\nSo, given the above data, if I had a car that was available in Red, Green & Blue (I don't do champagne), the way I normally do things, I'd have 3 rows come back in my recordset.\n\nIs there anyway to get all of the \"colors\" concatenated into a single field, or returned as an Array?  That way I can just have the 1 row for each car?",
