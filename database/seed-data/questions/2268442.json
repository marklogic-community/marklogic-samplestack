  "body": "\n\nOk, I don't know if this is possible.. Let me explain my situation.\n\nI currently have a DotNetNuke framework and I am trying to get off of it. Only way to get approved is to build a new framework that sits beside the DNN and slowly migrate the functionality out of DNN and onto the new framework.\n\nI don't want to have two different frameworks sitting on the same instance for maintainability purposes, I envision the DNN framework sitting in one and the new framework sitting in another but still maintaining the URL structure.\n\nFor example, www.url.com points to the DNN and if someone tries to resolve a page within a specified directory I want IIS to resolve from the other framework in another instance.\n\nIs this possible?",
