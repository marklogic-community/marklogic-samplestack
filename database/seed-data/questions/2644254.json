The script works perfectly but has one downside: **radio buttons inside the sliding div are unclickable / cannot be checked**. \n\nIf you hit the radio button of \"Keuzerondjes\" or \"Selectievakjes\", you'll see a div slides out - and that the radio button you just hit isn't checked. Does anyone have an idea how to solve this?",
