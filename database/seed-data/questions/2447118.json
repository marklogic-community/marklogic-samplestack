  "body": "\n\nI've been writing Java for the last couple of years , and now I've started to write in python (in addition). \n\nThe problem is that when I look at my Python code it looks like someone tried to hammer Java code into a python format , and it comes out crappy because - well , python ain't Java. \n\nAny tips on how to escape this pattern of \"Writing Java in Python\"? \n\nThanks!",
