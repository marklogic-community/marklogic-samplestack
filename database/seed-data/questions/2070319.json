  "body": "\n\nI'm investigating performance on an operation. I'm iterating a subset of items from a collection. I filter this collection using a Linq query. It basically looks like this:\n\n\tvar filteredItems = items.Where(x => x.PropertyToFilterOn == filterValue);\n\tforeach (var filteredItem in filteredItems)\n\t{\n\t    // do something to the filtered item\n\t}\n\t\n\nIf I use `Select` instead of `Where` I achieve the same thing. Which is better to use and what is the difference?",
