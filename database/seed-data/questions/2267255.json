  "body": "\n\nAs part of a general move to Windows 7  - where all applications should have an \"installer experience\", I need to create installers for all of our application suite. I have looked at [InstallShield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InstallShield), but this seems extremely expensive for what it does. What install products could I look at?\n\nThe installers will need to be built unattended on our build machines, so there is a level of complexity above just being an installer builder.\n\n**Update:**\n\nI have looked at all of the suggestions and they look good. My plans involve pushing stuff up by [SCCM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Center_Configuration_Manager) (or something similar) to the end users. Would I need to have MSI support for that?",
