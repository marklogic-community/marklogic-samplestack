I'm using WebForms.\n\nI have an ASPX page with two UpdatePanels, one on the left that holds a TreeView and other on the right where I load dynamically user controls.\n\nOn the left panel I also have buttons to load user controls on the right. I have a ModalPopupExtender in a button that show I div with radiobuttons to select a type. When I choose an option and click ok it do a postback to load dynamically a user control but instead of dissapear these modal panel it appers on the bottom left corner of the page.\n\nWhat's happening? I think it is about dynamic load.",
