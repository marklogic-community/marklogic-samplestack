I did some searching around the internet and [found a company that sells graphical improvements to various GUI components](http://www.dotnetmagic.com/) in .NET, but that costs $400.  Given that I am working on a master's project, that is out of the question, does anybody have any other suggestions for \"prettying\" up the tabs.  Thanks.\n\n**Edit**: My mistake - I forgot to put that I am using Windows.Forms.",
