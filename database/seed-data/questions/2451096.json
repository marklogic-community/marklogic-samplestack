  "body": "\n\nBasically I did the Cavendish experiment, and I have a damped sinusoidal wave plotted on Excel. With Position (mm) against Time (s).\n\nMy problem is that I have added a tread line through the wave function, and wish to calculate the points of which the wave function intersects the tread line. From this I will then be able to calculate the time period.\n\nAt the moment I'm just having difficulty getting the intersects..\n\nThanks",
