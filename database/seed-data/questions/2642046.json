  "body": "\n\nI have a single installation of java in a system that runs 2 or 3 applications. \n\nAll the applications use the same runtime.\n\nIs there a way to specify a different keystores for the ca certs than the one in java_home/jre/lib/security. That is, is there an option to specify an \"extra\" keystore that is loaded and added to the certs loaded from java_home/jre/lib/security/cacerts?\n\nWhat I want to avoid is having to re-import our local ca every time I upgrade the jdk in the box.",
