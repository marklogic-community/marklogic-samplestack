  "body": "\n\nI'm trying to create a efficient query which will retrieve 'projects' from a database and all the relevant 'tags' which have been assigned to that particular project.\n\nMy table setup mimics that of wordpress, and is a tad complicated:\n\n\tterm\n\t- Where I define the tags name, slug etc\n\t\n\tterm_relationships\n\t- Links the project to a term in the above table.\n\t\n\tterm_taxonomy\n\t- Defines the taxonomy of each of terms in the term table e.g. 'category', 'tag'.\n\t\n\nSo, what I need to do is first query the term_taxonomy table for any entries with the taxonomy 'tag', then filter these results so that only the terms specified in term_relationships are returned. Finally I then need to query the term table to return the relevant tags.\n\nMy question is which is fastest way of doing this? I imagine it would be best to split it into multiple queries eg. Query 1: retrieve project, Query 2: retrieve project tags but please consider I may have up to 20-30 projects per page.\n\nPS: I know it'd be far easier to just create a new table specifically for tagging, but I'd like to confine it to my current setup for now.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated, as this is driving me mad!",
