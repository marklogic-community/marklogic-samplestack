  "body": "\n\nI have to program websites, but I rather don't like the static HTML nature. I prefer more of a client-server architecture.\n\nNow I've figured, that with XMLhttp, you can basically dynamically update your page and send/request for information/action to/from a server. So this would basically cover the client area.\n\nBut to complete a client-server architecture, it is necessary for the server to send/request information, too, without being queried.\n\nIs there any way, for example for a chat server, to send back a received message to all clients (the clients use a web browser) without that the clients have to query in a fixed interval? I want to implement that one can see while you type something in.",
