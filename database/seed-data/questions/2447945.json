  "body": "\n\nNot sure if I can do it this way. I want to get current snapshot of the database and send it via FTP Server, both of this functionality should be implemented in PHP scripts. \n\nHere are the steps I am thinking on right now. \n\nIn my php scripts(basically am extending an PDO into my Dao class and then preparing the query),\n\n\t $qry = SELECT * FROM MyTablename;\n\t $stmt = $this->prepare($qry);\n\t $stmt = $this->execute();\n\t\n\nNow I will store `$stmt` in csv file using `fputcsv` or I will execute the `sql` command from the script itself and than try to store the result in the `$file(csv file)` note here that I do not have any csv file with me at this point to basically I will have to create one and let's say its `$file`, so then\n\n\t$file = fputcsv($stmt); or $file = exec(\"Select * from MyTablename\");\n\t\n\nWill this put all records in the file ? If yes, then I will use FTP Functionality to transfer file to the FTP Folder. \n\nI am not sure if this approach would work and also have concerns regarding the need of preparing the `$qry`\n\nAny suggestions or different approach advised would be highly appreciated. \n\nThanks !!!",
