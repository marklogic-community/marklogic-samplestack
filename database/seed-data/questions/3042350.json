[This](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2648/what-php-framework-would-you-choose-for-a-new-application-and-why) and [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/420048/any-tips-on-how-to-learn-cakephp-for-a-beginner) question were 2 years old. I'd like to know is there any update of opinion for year 2010?\n\nMy background on web development is mainly rails. I can code in PHP (for example, write a module for Drupal) but never used any PHP framework for any project.\n\nI can see the following potential features to be needed in my project:\n* `authlogic`-like user access control\n* `will_paginate`-like paging for long listings\n* `paperclip`-like simple file upload\n* `prawn`-like PDF generation\n* restful url\n\nand my personal favorite ruby/rails features:\n* activerecord \n* `<% @list.each do |item| %>` synstax instead of `for ($i=1; $i<=$row_num; $i++)` ...\n* `rake:db migrate`\n* `script/console`\n\nThanks!",
