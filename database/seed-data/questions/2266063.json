  "body": "\n\nMy windows service is a data server with substantial cache. During service OnStop I save the cache so that no data is lost. Saving cache may take several minutes so to prevent windows service manager from timeout I use SetServiceStatus Win32 callback:\n\n\tthis.serviceStatus.currentState = (int)State.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING;\n\tthis.serviceStatus.checkPoint = 1;\n\tthis.serviceStatus.waitHint = 60000;\n\tSetServiceStatus(Process.GetCurrentProcess().Handle, ref this.serviceStatus);\n\t\n\nThat works fine. \n\nI have also set CanShutdown to true and added OnShutdown so that service would be system shutdown proof. Here I effectively do the same thing as in OnStop:\n\n\tprotected override void OnShutdown()\n\t{\n\t    this.OnStop(); \n\t    base.OnShutdown();\n\t}\n\t\n\nThat does not work too good. When system shuts down, when cache is being saved I get \"The device is not ready\". This suggests that Windows aborts service before it is done stopping / shutting down. Preventing that with SetServiceStatus apparently does not work.\n\nHow do I get more time (delay reboot) to get saving done?\n\nAny suggestions welcome.",
