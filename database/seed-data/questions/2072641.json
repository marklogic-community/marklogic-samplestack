  "body": "\n\nWe have table with several full text indexed fields. Say, it is firstName, surName and lastName. I'm looking for \"John AND Smith\" and obviously these two words most likely will be written in different fields. Query returns nothing. If I search for \"John OR Smith\" it is working.\n\nThe question is: can I somehow tell SQL Server that all fields belonging to one row of specific table should be treated as one continuous text fragment?\n\nOf course, I can concat fields manually to special field and index it, but it looks quite silly. \n\nJust in case, the query. It's not about person's name, but idea is the same:\n\n\tSELECT [id], [type], [accessClass], [rank] \n\tFROM ( \n\tSELECT DISTINCT temp_result.* \n\tFROM ( \n\t    select SDF_Article.article_id [id], \n\t    6 [type], SDF_Object.accessClass [accessClass], RelevanceTable.[rank] [rank] \n\t    from SDF_Article inner join SDF_Object SDF_Object \n\t    on SDF_Article.article_id=SDF_Object.object_id \n\t    inner join SDF_Article_Locale SDF_Article_Locale \n\t    on SDF_Article.article_id=SDF_Article_Locale.article \n\t    inner join ContainsTable(SDF_Article_Locale, (title, body, brief),\n\t    'FORMSOF (INFLECTIONAL, hello) AND FORMSOF (INFLECTIONAL, world)', Language 'Russian') RelevanceTable \n\t    on SDF_Article_Locale.entry_id=RelevanceTable.[KEY] \n\t    ) AS temp_result \n\tINNER JOIN SDF_RelationMap SDF_Map \n\tON temp_result.[id] = SDF_Map.object AND SDF_Map.ancestor = 5 ) \n\tAS result ORDER BY [rank] desc\n\t\n\nWe are using SQL Server 2005.",
