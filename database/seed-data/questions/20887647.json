  "body": "\n\nAlthough I found an article about [OMT vs. UML](http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-uml-and-omt) I can't figure out the consequences of using OMT instead of UML- class diagram. What are the benefits of OMT compared to UML- class diagram? As far I know I can depict a class diagram in nearly the same way than this is done by using UML, or are there any known circumstances where only OMT is able to illustrate a specific context? And a bit more interesting question is, what are the cretera that tell when do I choose which one of those two modeling tools?",
