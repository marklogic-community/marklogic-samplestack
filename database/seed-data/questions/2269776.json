Now I'm doing it in Python and it's not working :(\n\n\tcursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO life(user_id, utm)  values(%s,PointFromWKB(point(%s,%s)))\",the_user_id, utm_easting, utm_northing)\n\t\n\nI even did float(utm_easting) and float(utm_northing)\n\nEdit: this is the error:\n\n**execute() takes at most 3 arguments (5 given)**",
