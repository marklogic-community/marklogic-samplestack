  "body": "\n\nI use an email registration and confirmation in my project (yes, I know about OpenID. In my counry, a main email service lacks it).\n\nSometimes users misspell their email addresses. I know about this due to \"message could not be delivered\" letters in a mailbox. A misspelled address is absolutely correct, because I check it with a regular expression - say, **jon**.doe@example.com intstead of **john**.doe@example.com. And I do not want to duplicate a email field in a registration form (who likes it?).\n\nRequest processing routine cannot wait for email delivery - it could take an unpredictable time. So, my script will return to user a confirmation message \"An email was sent\". And the user will wait for it forever (of cause, not - he/she will turn to an alternative project with a more perfect registration system).\n\nDoes someone knows how it can be improved (in any programming language)?",
