  "body": "\n\nI have this table\n\n\ttblStore\n\t\n\nwith these fields\n\n\tstoreID (autonumber)  \n\tstoreName  \n\tlocationOrBranch\n\t\n\nand this table\n\n\ttblPurchased\n\t\n\nwith these fields\n\n\tpurchasedID  \n\tstoreID (foreign key)  \n\titemDesc\n\t\n\nIn the case of stores that have more than one location, there is a problem when two people inadvertently key the same store location differently. For example, take Harrisburg Chevron. On some of its receipts it calls itself Harrisburg Chevron, some just say Chevron at the top, and under that, Harrisburg. One person may key it into tblStore as storeName Chevron, locationoOrBranch Harrisburg. Person2 may key it as storeName Harrisburg Chevron, locationOrBranch Harrisburg. What makes this bad is that the business's name is Harrisburg Chevron. It seems hard to make a rule (that would understandably cover all future opportunities for this error) to prevent people from doing this in the future.\n\nQuestion 1) I'm thinking as the instances are found, an update query to change all records from one way to the other is the best way to fix it. Is this right?\n\nQuestions 2) What would be the best way to have originally set up the db to have avoided this?\n\nQuestion 3) What can I do to make future after-the-fact corrections easier when this happens?\n\nThanks.\n\n<b>edit</b>: I do understand that better business practices are the ideal prevention, but for question 2 I'm looking for any tips or tricks that people use that could <i>help</i>.  And question 1 and 3 are important to me too.",
