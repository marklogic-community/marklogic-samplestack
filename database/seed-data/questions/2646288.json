  "body": "\n\nI need to retrieve some info from web. For example, I can visit weather.com to search my zip code to get HTML file that contains the temperature or something. I need to make a python script to do this automatically. \n\nI think there are two ways to do this.\n1. Run wget to download the web page, parse it to get the information I want.\n2. If the website provides the web service, just run it to get the info.\n\nAnd these are my questions.\n1. What function do I use for the web service in python?\n2. How can I know if a web site provides what web service?\n3. If web service is not provided, is there a better way than run wget and parse?\n\nIf you can give me some examples, that would be much better. ",
