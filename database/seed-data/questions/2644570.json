I would like to center it (together with text label) vertically on the button. \n\n'android:gravity' seems to work only on text label. It does not affect 'drawableTop' positioning.\n\nI was able to center it vertically using 'android:paddingTop' - but that does not seem to be a good idea. I guess it would not work properly on different screen resolution/size.",
