I'm trying to get multiple file extensions in the drop-down box, but have no idea how to do it.\n\nThere is the method\n\n\textFilter = FileNameExtensionFilter(description, extensions);\n\t\n\nthat I can then use by writing\n\n\tfileChooser.setFileFilter(extFilter);\n\t\n\nhowever, as you can see, this only supports one option in the drop-down list. How do I add more?",
