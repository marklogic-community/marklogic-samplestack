  "body": "\n\nI have a complex `UserControl` with the main purpose to encapsulate `DropDownList` with a number of properties for advanced manipulation.\n\nList is being populated on `PreRender` event depending on properties previously were set:\n\n\tprotected void Page_PreRender(object sender, EventArgs e)\n\t{\n\t    sourceClient.SelectCommand = this.Property1 ? \"exec a\" : \"exec b\";\n\t}\n\t\n\nThe most used property is ClientID:\n\n\t[Category(\"Settings\")]\n\tpublic int ClientID\n\t{\n\t   get\n\t   {\n\t      return Int32.Parse(DropDownList1.SelectedItem.Value);\n\t   }\n\t   set\n\t   {\n\t      DropDownList1.Items.FindByValue(value).Selected = true;\n\t   }\n\t}\n\t\n\nGetter commonly is being called by `ControlPameters` in `SqlDataSources` on pages with this control.\n\nSetter - from markup: `<uc:UserControl1 runat=\"server\" ClientID='<%# Bind(\"ID\") %>' />`.\n\nSo the question is:\n\nWhy does setter from `Bind` is called earlier then `PreRender`? And `DropDownList` is empty and item selecting doesn't work! How to workaround this behavior?\n\nEdit1: Ok, not `PreRender` but `Init`. But DropDownList1_DataBinding is still being called after property setter!",
