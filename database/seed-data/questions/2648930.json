  "body": "\n\nI'm currently working on my first WPF application, and I'm curious as to whether I'll hit a snag down the line with performance by doing something like this:\n\n\tDim binding As New Binding(\"PropertyOnObject.Property1.Property2.Value\")\n\tbinding.Source = Object\n\t\n\nvs doing\n\n\tDim binding As New Binding(\"Value\")\n\tbinding.Source = Object.PropertyOnObject.Property1.Property2\n\t\n\nMy objects are fairly dynamic, in that PropertyOnObject can change(and thus changing Property1 and Property2), so it makes sense to do it the first way. Is there a performance penalty for that, though?",
