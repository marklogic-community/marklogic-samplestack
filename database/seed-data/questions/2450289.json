  "body": "\n\nMap Reduce is a pattern that seems to get a lot of traction lately and I start to see it manifest in one of my projects that is focused on an event processing pipeline (iPhone Accelerometer and GPS data). I needed to built a lot of infrastructure for this project, in fact it overweighs the logic code interacting with it by 2x. Some of the components I built where EventProcessors (with in- and outputbuffers, timing etc.), EventListeners, Aggregators and a staged Pipeline. \n\nThis leads me to my question what the \"common\" required infrastrucutre for map reduce is. Since I am working with .Net a lot I can see map reduce infrastructure built into the Framework and language constructs. Functional languages support this paradigm per se. It seems every language can be used with map reduce. There are even languages *built* around that concept (e.g. Go).\n\n[Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/mapreduce/) brings Map-Reduce to Java. Google has [patented a map-reduce framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce). What kind of infrastructure do they provide to enable map reduce? What are the constructs exhibited in functional languages to implement map reduce? What needs/should a map-reduce framework provide?",
