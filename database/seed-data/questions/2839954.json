I have experience developing web apps in Ruby on Rails (& a little with Java with JSP pages & struts mvc).\n\nShould I jump straight to MVC framework?  (as opposed to going ASP.net)  That is from the point of view of future direction for Microsoft & as well ease in ramping up from myself.\n\nOr if you like, given my experience to date, what would the pros/cons for me re MVC versus ASP.net?\n\nthanks",
