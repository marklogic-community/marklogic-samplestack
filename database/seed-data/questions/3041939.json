  "body": "\n\nI need a modal dialog to open ontop of an tinyMCE editor and other jQuerified items. I followed the jquery site but its not modal, I can still change and access the rest of the page.\n\n\t$('#sureDelete').dialog({\n\t                    modal: true,\n\t                    buttons: {\n\t                        \"Yes\": function(){\n\t                            $('li#'+$id).remove();\n\t                        },\n\t                        \"No\":function(){\n\t                        }\n\t                    },\n\t                    draggable: false\n\t        });\n\t<div id=\"dialogs\">\n\t\n\n`<div id=\"sureDelete\">Are you sure you want to delete this page?</div>``</div>`\nAlso I don't have any styling added to the dialog. Can that be an issue?",
