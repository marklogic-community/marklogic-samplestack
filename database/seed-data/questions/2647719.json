  "body": "\n\nI just created an iPhone app and am having friends try it out, but it seems like there's a lot of stuff that needs 'management' in order to have efficient development/test cycles. There are also a bunch of things which are only on my machine (the Keychain and my test cert that I use to create the app/provisioning profiles) which other developers on the team cannot use.\n* How are folks managing the different kinds of iPhone certs and provisioning profiles? \n* Any suggested best practices on how to efficiently build/test/provision app builds in ways that anyone from the team can do it?\n* What exactly needs to be backed up in case I want to re-build my mac or use another mac to do developments/builds?\n* Which of these artifacts are needed for actual deployment to the app store? Do I need to re-create certs, profiles etc or do I just re-use the ones I've created for development?",
