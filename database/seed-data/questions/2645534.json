When I look at \"View and manage Microsoft Office Add-ins\" the publisher shows up as None.\n\nWould code signing with a Software Publisher Certificate fill in the Publisher field?\n\nThe ClickOnce manifest is signed with a Code Signing certificate.\n\nWould signing the assembly with a strong name key file fill in the Publisher field?\n\nIs there a method using codesign.exe that would fill in the Publisher field?\n\nNote: Using signtool.exe to sign the addin dll with the certificate results in the publisher showing as None in Word.",
