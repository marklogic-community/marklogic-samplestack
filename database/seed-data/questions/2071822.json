  "body": "\n\nas a warning I have very limited experience with PHP, with just over 1 month of learning it.\n\nI have a textform that when its submitted it goes through str_replaces on the allowed tags (eg [img]) to turn them into html tags.\n\nWhat I want to do Is grab the URLS from the $string and add links to the original image and the url to the resized. What im basically asking, i guess, is how do i grab urls from a string? so that I can use them to add links to resized imgs.\n\n\t<a href=\"linkToOriginal\"><img src=\"\"location/resize.php?file=', $string);`\n\t\n\nwhat i do at the moment is just replace [img] with html img tag which is put right next to the url in the text field. $string being the large body of text.\n\n\t $imageOpen = str_replace('[img]', '<img src=\"http://location/resize.php?file=', $string);\n\t   $imageClose = str_replace('[/img]', '\"/></a>', $imageOpen);\n\t\n\nIf this isnt clear please tell me, as im pretty awful at explaining things!",
