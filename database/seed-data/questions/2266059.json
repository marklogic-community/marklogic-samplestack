  "body": "\n\nHi\nI have  an application running on VxWorks 5.5.1\nIt basically allocates a STL map data structure but in some cases my\nmain task crashes.\nWhen I monitor via debugger, the allocated size for an STL  map type\nvariable has the value of another task's ID instead of 8.\n\nSo it seems like a task ID and a variable is mixing.\n\nThe problem occurs in consecutive start and stop of  main task.\nCould it possible, TCB block of a task overwrites an area in memory\nRegards ",
