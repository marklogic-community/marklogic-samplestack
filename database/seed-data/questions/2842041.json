Currently I'm using the one found at thehorizontalway.com (called thw.js) but it doesn't seem to work in all browsers (Chrome).\n\nI'm trying to get this one to work: [http://brandonaaron.net/code/mousewheel/docs](http://brandonaaron.net/code/mousewheel/docs) , to simply scroll the whole window, nothing else. There is very limited documentation so I can't figure it out. Any help is appreciated.",
