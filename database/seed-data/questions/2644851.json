  "body": "\n\nI have the problem, that MSSQL Server 2000 should select some distinct values from a table (the specific column is of the nvarchar type).\nThere are the sometimes the same values, but with different cases, for example (pseudocode):\n\n\tSELECT DISTINCT * FROM (\"A\", \"a\", \"b\", \"B\")\n\t\n\nwould return\n\n\tA,b\n\t\n\nBut I do want (and do expect)\n\n\tA,a,b,B\n\t\n\nbecause they actually are different values.\n\nAny idea how to solve this problem?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",
