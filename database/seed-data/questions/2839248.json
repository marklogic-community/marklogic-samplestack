  "body": "\n\nHere's my code:\n\n\t<div class=\"image\">\n\t<img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" />\n\t<p class=\"caption\">This is the image caption</p>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\nHere's my CSS:\n\n\t.image {\n\tposition: relative;\n\tfloat: right;\n\tmargin: 8px 0 10px 10px;\n\t}\n\t\n\t.caption {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n\tcolor: #444666;\n\t}\n\t\n\nAs is above, the caption will conform to the width of div.image. My problem is often the **img** varies in size, from 100px width to 250px width. I'd like to make the caption width conform to the corresponding width of the image, no matter the size.\n\nWhile I'd love for this to be more semantic as well, I'm not sure how easy it would be to switch **p.caption** with **img**. Of course, I'd prefer that method but am taking this a step at a time.\n\nIs there some jquery code that I can use to detect the width of the image and add that width as an inline style to the caption tag?\n\nIs there a better way to do this? I'm open to suggestions.",
