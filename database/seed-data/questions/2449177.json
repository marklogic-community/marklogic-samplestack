  "body": "\n\nfrom an instance of Site with a ManyToMany relationship to Kiosk, i'd like to check if a Kiosk object is part of the relationship.\n\nI could do \n\n\tself.apps.get(id=app_id).exists() and check if True\n\t\n\nor \n\n\tself.apps.get(id=app_id) and catch the ObjectDoesNotExist error\n\t\n\nor \n\n\tself.apps.filter(id=app_id) and check if True\n\t\n* If I have to catch a possible ObjectDoesNotExist error, I may as well use the second one\n* I can do the second but doesnt seem super clean\n* can use the third one but using filter on a unique ID seems wrong to me\n\nYou can tell me to use whatever works and that'll be a valid answer ;-)",
