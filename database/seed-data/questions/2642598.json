I [see from MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sz6zd40f%28VS.80%29.aspx) that generics are usually used with collections\n\n> The most common use for generic\n  classes is with collections like\n  linked lists, hash tables, stacks,\n  queues, trees and so on where\n  operations such as adding and removing\n  items from the collection are\n  performed in much the same way\n  regardless of the type of data being\n  stored.\n\nThe examples I have seen also validate the above statement. \n\nCan someone give a valid use of generics in a real-life scenario which does not involve any collections ?\n\nPedantically, I was thinking about making an example which does not involve collections\n\n\tpublic class Animal<T>\n\t{\n\t    public void Speak()\n\t    {\n\t       Console.WriteLine(\"I am an Animal and my type is \" + typeof(T).ToString());\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    public void Eat()\n\t    {\n\t        //Eat food\n\t    }\n\t}\n\t\n\tpublic class Dog\n\t{\n\t    public void WhoAmI()\n\t    {\n\t        Console.WriteLine(this.GetType().ToString());\n\t\n\t    }\n\t}         \n\t\n\nand \"An Animal **of type** Dog\" will be \n\n`Animal<Dog> magic = new Animal<Dog>();`\n\nIt is entirely possible to have `Dog` getting inherited from `Animal` (Assuming a non-generic version of `Animal`)`Dog:Animal` Therefore `Dog`**is an**`Animal`\n\nAnother example I was thinking was a  `BankAccount`. It can be `BankAccount<Checking>`,`BankAccount<Savings>`. This can very well be `Checking:BankAccount` and `Savings:BankAccount`.\n\nAre there any best practices to determine if we should go with generics or with inheritance ?           ",
