  "body": "\n\nI have a WPF UserControl, which I use in a WinForms Control within an ElementHostControl. Then I start a WPF Window, while the Windows Form is still open. If I then close the WPF Window, and try to add a Child Element to my WPF UserControl, it crashes at \"InitializeComponent()\" (of the Child Element) with the exception:\n\n> \"A first chance exception of type 'System.Configuration.ConfigurationErrorsException' occurred in System.Configuration.dll.\n  Additional information: This element is not currently associated with any context\"\n\nI found out why it happens, but I don't know how to solve the problem. If I leave out this code:\n\n\tpublic static void EnsureApplicationResources()\n\t    {\n\t        if (Application.Current == null)\n\t        {\n\t            // create the Application object\n\t            new Application();\n\t            string assemblyName = System.IO.Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(\n\t                Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().ManifestModule.Name);\n\t\n\t            // merge in your application resources\n\t            Application.Current.Resources.MergedDictionaries.Add(\n\t                Application.LoadComponent(new Uri(\"/KolonistenClient;component/KolonistenResourceDictionary.xaml\", UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute))\n\t                as ResourceDictionary);\n\t        }\n\t    }\n\t\n\nthen everything is fine. I need that though, because of the fact that my ResourceDictionary (and thus also my defined styles and templates) is otherwise not available throughout the WPF Window and Controls. [This I found out about here](http://drwpf.com/blog/2007/10/05/managing-application-resources-when-wpf-is-hosted/)\n\nIs there any way to combine the best of both worlds? Keeping my ResourceDictionary, while preventing the application from crashing?",
