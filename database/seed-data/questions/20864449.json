All that seems to work are string values.  Does anyone know why this is happening?  I thought the point of a blob column was it could be more general.\n\nMy goal is to have a column that can take multiple data types.  Plan B would be to store the datatype name in it's own column and then type cast a string representation back when the data is retrieved, but I'd like to understand why the blog is failing.",
