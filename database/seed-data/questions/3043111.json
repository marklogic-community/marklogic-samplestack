  "body": "\n\nI have a sample ASP.NET application. The appliaction was developed as POC and not following any design and architectural standards.\n\nNow I want to restructure the application. I can see some of the business logic and controls can be reused in future, such as login control.\n\nI have two options for restructuring \n\n1. I create a Utility DLL that will contain all such resusable code and another DLL that will contain all controls that can be reused.\n\n2. I will create a separeate DLL for each type which can be reused e.g. Login control.\n\nWhich option is more better. Although I feel option 1 is good, but I need suggestion from experts.",
