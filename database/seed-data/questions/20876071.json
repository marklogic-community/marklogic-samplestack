I don't have any money to spend on software. I am also a complete beginner to image processing!\n\nThanks,\nFjpackard.", "lastActivityDate":"2014-01-02T14:12:45.173", "title":"Easiest image processing on Mac", "tags":["osx", "image-processing", "computer-vision", "tracking"], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
