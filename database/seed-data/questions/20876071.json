  "body": "\n\nI am looking for an easy way to process images as an app on Mac – e.g. tracking moving objects, finding objects/faces etc.\n\nThis was inspired by a recent SO post: [How to detect a Christmas Tree?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20772893/how-to-detect-a-christmas-tree)\n\nWhat is the best language for me to code this in, and how would I do it? I don't have any money to spend on software. I am also a complete beginner to image processing!\n\nThanks,\nFjpackard.",
