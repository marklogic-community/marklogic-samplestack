  "body": "\n\nWhen building our Java applications in Eclipse, the Spring builder is very slow and gives no status updates.\n\nSpecifically, I start building a project, and Eclipse's Progress pane displays\n\n> Invoking 'Spring Project Builder' on 'project name'...\n\nfor multiple minutes at a time, with no additional details.\n\nI've already turned off the Spring AOP Reference Model Builder, and I just recently disabled the Spring project builder completely out of desperation.\n\nI'm just building and using these projects, not developing them, so theoretically they should compile fine - but this is our development branch, so I'd still like to keep Spring on in case there's a nasty reflection error somewhere.\n\nSo, in order to keep using them, is there anything I can do to:\n1. Speed the Spring portion of the build?\n2. Display more detailed output during the Spring project building process?\n\n**Edit 2010-02-15 21:39 GMT:**\n\nI'm specifically referring to the Spring IDE plugin in Eclipse.",
