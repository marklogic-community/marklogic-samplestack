  "body": "\n\nIn short, I have a very large photo gallery and I'm trying to cache as many of the thumbnail images as I can when the first page loads.  There could be 1000+ thumbnails.\n\nFirst question -- is it stupid to try to preload/cache that many?\n\nSecond question -- when the `preload()` function fires, the entire browser stops responding for a minute to two.  At which time the callback fires, so the preload is complete.  Is there a way to accomplish \"smart preloading\" that doesn't impede on the user experience/speed when attempting to load this many objects?\n\nThe `$.preLoadImages` function is take from here: [http://binarykitten.me.uk/dev/jq-plugins/107-jquery-image-preloader-plus-callbacks.html](http://binarykitten.me.uk/dev/jq-plugins/107-jquery-image-preloader-plus-callbacks.html)\n\nHere's how I'm implementing it:\n\n\t$(document).ready(function() {\n\t    setTimeout(\"preload()\", 5000);\n\t});\n\tfunction preload() {\n\t    var images = ['image1.jpg', ... 'image1000.jpg'];\n\t    $.preLoadImages(images, function() { alert('done'); });\n\t}\n\t\n\n1000 images is a lot.  Am I asking too much?",
