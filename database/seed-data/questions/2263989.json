  "body": "\n\nI have a Customer list that will have Invoices and Emails linked to it.\n\nI have my customer/details/1 and customer/edit/1 working as per the default route but would like to have it instead be like below\n* customer - Lists customers  \n* customer/1/edit - Edit Customer ID 1  \n* customer/1/details - Details of Customer ID 1  \n* customer/1/invoice - Invoice List for Customer ID 1  \n* customer/1/invoice/3 - Details of Invoice ID 3 for Customer ID 1\n\nI setup the following route (before the default route)\n\n\troutes.MapRoute(\"CustomerActions\", \n\t    \"customer/{customerid}/{action}/{id}\",\n\t    new { controller = \"customer\", action = \"details\", id=\"\" } \n\t);\n\t\n\nWhich seems to work, but in my customer edit view I have an ActionLink like\n\n\t<%=Html.ActionLink(\"Back to List\", \"Index\") %>\n\t\n\nBut it gives the URL \n\n/customer/1/index rather than just /customer or /customer/index",
