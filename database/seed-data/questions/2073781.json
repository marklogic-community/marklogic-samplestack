  "body": "\n\nI need some help with a LINQ query in VB.Net, please.\n\nI have this simple group statement:\n\n\tDim drivers = From d In DriversOwners _\n\t   Group d By Key = d.UnitNumber Into Group _\n\t   Select Key, DriverGroup = Group\n\t\n\nThis works, and returns me the data I need to work with. Now I want to iterate through the groups, using a For Each construct. like this: \n\n\tFor Each x In drivers\n\t\n\tNext\n\t\n\nHowever, the compiler is barking at me, telling me that the \n\n\"'x' is not accessible in this context because it is 'Friend'.\"\n\nAnyone know what I am doing wrong here?\n\nThanks in advance.",
