  "body": "\n\nI'm wondering how to best tackle this, since what I have now works great for a hard-coded column in my view -- I'm wondering how I can extend it to allow the column to be dynamic.\n\nCONTROLLER:\n\n\tvar dc = new DataContextDC();\n\treturn View(dc.items.Where(i=>i.IsPublic == true));\n\t\n\nVIEW:\n\n\t<% foreach (var grp in Model.GroupBy(s => s.GroupColumn)) { %>\n\t    <%= Html.Encode(grp.Key) %>\n\t    <% foreach (var item in grp) { %>\n\t        <%= Html.Encode(item.Title) %>\n\t    <% } %>\n\t<% } %>\n\t\n\nAs stated, the objective is to let the user choose which column replaces \"GroupColumn\" above. I'd like to avoid adding any external libraries, etc.\n\nI see using reflection (slow, but fully dynamic) or since this is one View in my application, I just duplicate the above code for each column in the database and then put a switch statement on it (quick, and dirty, but effective)",
