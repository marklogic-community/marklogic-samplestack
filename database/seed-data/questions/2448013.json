  "body": "\n\nI gave to Google Guice the responsability of wiring my objects. But, How can I test if the bindings are working well.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a class A which has a dependence B. How can I test than B is injected correctly.\n\n<pre>\n  class A {\n    private B b;\n\n    public A() {}\n\n    @Inject\n    public void setB(B b) {\n      this.b = b\n    }\n  }\n</pre>\n\nNotice A hasn't got a getB() method and I want to assert that A.b isn't null.",
