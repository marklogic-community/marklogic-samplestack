  "body": "\n\nI need to develop a very simple class developed as a Windows Script Component that needs to work in a multi-threaded environment.\nI am wondering just how thread safe Windows scripting Components are and the scripting engine that executes those components.\nIn VB6 if a compiled DLL was not compile with \"Retain In Memory\" and \"Unattended Execution\" set definately caused problems in a multi threaded environment, I experienced this 1st hand and spent weeks trying to locate the issue with a 3rd party DLL.\nWould anyone happen to know what way Windows Scripting Component works, are they intrinsically thread safe (once we don't do anything non-thread safe in the components we write).\n\nI realize that the Windows Script Components are COM Apartment threaded and may not be the most performant things in the world but I have no choice about this.\n\nKind Regards\n\nNoel",
