  "body": "\n\nMy program consists of 2 parts  - A server socket running on a different thread, and a client to test the server. I'm 99.9% sure that the server is correctly written (because I have tested it with a client socket), and all it does is returns \"hello world\" as a response. The server sits on port 3490. \n\nNow what I tried to do is to call the server in the following way:\n\n\tNSData *data = [[NSData alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@\"http://localhost:3490\"]];\n\t    NSString *msg = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];\n\t    NSLog(msg);\n\t\n\nBut I get no response. I suspect that the problem is with the address [http://localhost:3490](http://localhost:3490)\n\nThis problem appears on the iphone an on mac.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks\n\nAlex\n\nI have this problem on the iphone and on mac.
