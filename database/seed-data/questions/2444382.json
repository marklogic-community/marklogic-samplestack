  "body": "\n\nI'm trying to develop a function that can sort through a string that looks like this:\n\n\tDonny went to the {park|store|{beach with friends|beach alone}} so he could get a breath of fresh air. \n\t\n\nWhat I intend to do is search the text recursively  for {*} patterns where there is no { or } inside the {*}, so only the innermost sandwiched text is selected, where I will then run a php to array the contents and select one at random, repeating process until the whole string has been parsed, showing a complete sentence. \n\nI just cannot wrap my head around regular expressions though. \n\nAppreciate any help!",
