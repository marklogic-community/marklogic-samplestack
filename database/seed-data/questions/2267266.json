  "body": "\n\nI am working on replacing an old ms access system with an SQL server one with a C# front end. Unfortunately I have some die hard ms access users who will be accessing the SQL server tables from ms access but to them it should essentially look the same.\n\nWhen tables are created in ms access and a relationship is created between them they show in a hierarchical view with a + sign to get to the lower table in the hierarchy.\n\nIs there a way to replicate this when using linked SQL Server tables? I have tried replicating the relationships in SQL server with ones in ms access but it had no effect.",
