Our business domain has two crucial concepts named `Case` and `Flag`. According to CA, it's apparently a deadly sin to use these names, however I really don't care since, as I said, they are crucial concepts in our domain model. CA complains not only about the type declarations but about every method parameter-name aswell. So does anyone know if there is a workaround other than adding loads of suppressions or disabling the rule altogether? Could I add the names to a custom dictionary?",
