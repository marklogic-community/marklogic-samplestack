I found some things on google about injecting code or dll files but is it possible two merge two exe files or to inject exe into exe?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n**[EDIT]**\nThanks everyone. Just for those who said that it's not possible, I have to say I almost did it in the end in the way some suggested. It almost goes like this (I can't remember all of it cos it was a long time ago): \n\n[BEWARE: This algorithm is very similar to those of some worms and viruses. I am not a hacker or a virus writer! and this is to be used only for experimental or unharmful reasons - Making mistakes in the code can ruin the executables in directories.]\n\n1- The Exe checks itself's size to detect whether anything has been appended to itself. if it hasn't then:\n\n\t     1.1- The exe finds other executable files in its directory (lets call one of them as victim!)\n\t     1.2- it makes a copy of itself (lets call it newMe)\n\t     1.3- it copies the other executable found in the directory to the end of newMe.\n\t     1.4- it deletes the other executable file found and renames newMe to its victim's name.\n\t\n\n2- If the exe detects that something has been added to it then:\n\n\t     2.1- Then it copies data from itself (from ORIGINAL_FILE_SIZE to the end of file) to a new file (lets call it newBorn.exe)\n\t     2.2- It runs itself's code and then executes the newBorn.\n\t\n\nI said I ALMOST did it cos in this way the exe appends another exe to itself. but this could be repeated for appending and executing 2 or even 3 or more executables into one. you just have to know the ORIGINAL_FILE_SIZE of the written program.",
