  "body": "\n\nI would like manage a set of application requirements. Each requirement have a state (Accepted, Rejected, InProgress), and a message state. Some toolbuttons have to be enabled just if all the requirements are accepted.\n\nAll the requirements are viewed in a tableview (two colums : name and state message), with an icon state for each line.\n\nA requirement is checked by a separated worker. I do this with QtConcurrent/QThreadPool. But I have to know when the pool have finished all the checks.\n\nThere's no signal finished in QThreadPool...\n\nMaybe I do it wrong. Any idea, link or example are welcom !",
