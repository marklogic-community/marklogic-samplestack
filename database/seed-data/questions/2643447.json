I just get a grey cross in the middle of the video player area.\n* I've made sure that both Mongrel and Apache in each case have the right MIME types set.\n* From Chrome's results I know there is nothing inherently wrong with my video files or the way the files are being asked for or delivered.\n\nFor Firefox I looked at [https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_audio_and_video_in_Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_audio_and_video_in_Firefox) where it refers to an 'error' event and an 'error' attribute. It seems the 'error' event is thrown pretty well straightaway and at that time there is no error attribute. Does anyone know how to diagnose the problem? ",
