  "body": "\n\nOk what im trying to do is a kind of audio processing software that can detect a prevalent frequency an if the frequency is played for long enough (few ms) i know i got a positive match. i know i would need to use FFT or something simiral but in this field of math i suck, i did search the internet but didn not find a code that could do only this.\n\nthe goal im trying to accieve is to make myself a custom protocol to send data trough sound, need very low bitrate per sec (5-10bps) but im also very limited on the transmiting end so the recieving software will need to be able custom (cant use an actual hardware/software modem) also i want this to be software only (no additional hardware except soundcard)\n\nthanks alot for the help.",
