  "body": "\n\nI am trying to set a fetch request with a predicate to obtain records in the store whose identifiers attribute match an array of identifiers specified in the predicate e.g.\n\n\tNSString *predicateString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"identifier IN %@\", employeeIDsArray];\n\t\n\nThe employeeIDsArray contains a number of NSNumber objects that match IDs in the store. However, I get an error \"Unable to parse the format string\". This type of predicate works if it is used for filtering an array, but as mentioned, fails for a core data fetch. How should I set the predicate please?",
