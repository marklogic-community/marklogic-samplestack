What just happened is that thread has reported that it has processed all records, however, Visual Studio's debug window is still displaying out. I am positive that thread has completed its job.\n\nIs Debug.WriteLine Async or data has been stacked in Visual Studio's buffer and is getting displayed slowly?",
