  "body": "\n\nI use the Lucene java `QueryParser` with `KeywordAnalyzer`. A query like `topic:(hello world)` is broken up in to multiple parts by the `KeywordTokenizer` so the resulting Query object looks like this `topic:(hello) topic:(world)` i.e. Instead of one, I now have two key-value pairs. I would like the `QueryParser` to interpret `hello world` as one value, without using double quotes. What is the best way to do so?\n\nParsing `topic:(\"hello world\")` results in a single key value combination but, using double quotes is not an option.\n\nI am not using the Lucene search engine. I am using Lucene's QueryParser just for parsing the query, not for searching. The text `Hello World` is entered at runtime, by the user so that can change. I would like `KeywordTokenizer` to treat `Hello World` as one Token instead of parsing splitting it in to two Tokens.",
