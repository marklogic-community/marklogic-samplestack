  "body": "\n\nI know this same question was asked for Entity Framework 1, but now that Entity Framework 4 has come out, and Microsoft claims that it provides all of the features of Linq to Sql + more, does Entity Framework now support lazy loading expensive properties?  In Linq to Sql, this is extremely easy.  There's a Delay Loaded option on any property (accessible through the Designer) that can simply be toggled on or off.  Is there something similar in Entity Framework?\n\nThanks",
