The service returns a json object and the json data that the webservice wants look like this:\n\n\t\"data\" : \"my data\"\n\t\n\nThis is what I've come up with but I can't understand how I add the data to my request and send it and then parse the json data that I get back.\n\n\tstring data = \"test\";\n\tUri address = new Uri(\"http://localhost/Service.svc/json\");\n\tHttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(address);\n\trequest.Method = \"POST\";\n\trequest.ContentType = \"application/json; charset=utf-8\";\n\tstring postData = \"{\\\"data\\\":\\\"\" + data + \"\\\"}\";\n\t\n\nHow can I add my json data to my request and then parse the response?",
