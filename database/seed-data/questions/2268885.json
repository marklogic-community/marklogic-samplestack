  "body": "\n\nI'm hoping to use either Haskell or OCaml on a new project because R is too slow.  I need to be able to use support vectory machines, ideally separating out each execution to run in parallel.  I want to use a functional language and I have the feeling that these two are the best so far as performance and elegance are concerned (I like Clojure, but it wasn't as fast in a short test).  I am leaning towards OCaml because there appears to be more support for integration with other languages so it could be a better fit in the long run (e.g. [OCaml-R](http://home.gna.org/ocaml-r/)).\n\nDoes anyone know of a good tutorial for this kind of analysis, or a code example, in either Haskell or OCaml?
