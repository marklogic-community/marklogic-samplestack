  "body": "\n\nI have a custom `NSWindowController` subclass that loads a NIB file during initialization like this:\n\n\tself = [super initWithNibNamed:@\"myNib\"];\n\tif (self != nil) {\n\t    [self window];\n\t}\n\t\n\nThe nib contains some custom views and some other controls. The `NSWindowController` is the file's owner and at least one of the views even binds to it.\n\nSimply, what do I have to do to close and release that window? I spend the whole day trying to figure that out and I am still clueless. Please help me.",
