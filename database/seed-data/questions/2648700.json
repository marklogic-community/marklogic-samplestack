  "body": "\n\nI'm not entirely sure what to call what C# does, so I haven't had any luck searching for the VB.Net equivalent syntax (if it exists, which I suspect it probably doesn't).\n\nIn c#, you can do this:\n\n\tpublic void DoSomething() {\n\t    new MyHelper().DoIt(); // works just fine\n\t}\n\t\n\nBut as far as I can tell, in VB.Net, you must assign the helper object to a local variable or you just get a syntax error:\n\n\tPublic Sub DoSomething()\n\t    New MyHelper().DoIt() ' won't compile\n\tEnd Sub\n\t\n\nJust one of those curiosity things I run into from day to day working on mixed language projects - often there is a VB.Net equivalent which uses less than obvious syntax.  Anyone?",
