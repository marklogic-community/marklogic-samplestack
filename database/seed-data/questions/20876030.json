If I was doing this with SQL I would do something like this:\n\n\tupdate collectionA \n\tset collectionA.votes = collectionB.votes \n\tfrom collectionA \n\tinner join collectionB \n\ton collectionA._id = collectionB.collectionAId\n\t\n\nThe only way have found to do the equivalent of this with MongoDB is to use forEach or another client side cursor. With millions of documents, however, a client side cursor making millions of individual updates is extremely slow. How can I get this done in MongoDB with only 1 or a few client side calls and most of the work occurring on the actual database server?", "lastActivityDate":"2014-01-02T03:46:54.030", "title":"UPDATE SET FROM in MongoDB", "tags":["mongodb", "nosql"], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
