  "body": "\n\nGiven a simple zero based, numerically indexed array:\n\n\tvar list = ['Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz'];\n\t\n\nMany times, I have noticed that when someone suggests looping through variables in an array like this:\n\n\tfor(var item in list) { ... }\n\t\n\n...there's almost certainly someone suggesting that that's bad practice and suggests an alternative approach:\n\n\tvar count = list.length;\n\t\n\tfor(var i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n\t    var item = list[i];\n\t    ...\n\t}\n\t\n\nWhat's the reasoning for not using the simpler version above and to use the second example instead?",
