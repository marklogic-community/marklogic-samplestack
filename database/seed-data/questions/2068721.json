  "body": "\n\nI have something like this\n\n\tregister unsigned int a, b, c;\n\tint n;\n\tfor (n = 0; n < 10; ++n){\n\tc = a + b\n\tb = a\n\ta = c\n\tarray[n] = c;\n\t}\n\t\n\nwhat it does, it doesn't matter. The code runs quickly the way it is now, slower if the register keyword is removed. However, when I add in register before int n, it actually runs slower than now, but faster than if no registers is used.\n\nCan someone explain this to me? Thanks.",
