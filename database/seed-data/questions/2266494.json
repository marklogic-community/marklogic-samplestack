I have tried the code below, but it seems to be giving me false positives (aka comes out to true even when it's not in the table). Is there a better way?\n\n\tif not exists (select myID from tableName where myID = @myID and otherColumn = @otherColumn)\n\tbegin\n\t    insert into tableName\n\t        (\n\t            myID\n\t            , otherColumn\n\t        ) values (\n\t            @myID\n\t            , @otherColumn\n\t        )\n\tend\n\t",
