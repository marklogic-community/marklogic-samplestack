  "body": "\n\nI need to call (get) non-exported functions of a `DLL`. Unlike PE export table, non-exports do not have any table having entries for these. More over, all disassembler like IDAPro and other debuggers only show exported function names with decorated names (After Shift+F3 in case of IDA) and show all other functions like sub_000FF sorts of. \n\nAny idea how to get and call non-exported functions of `DLL` programmatically? (`GetProcAddress` after `LoadLibrary` only calls decorated exported functions not designed for non exports.)",
