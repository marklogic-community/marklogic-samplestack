  "body": "\n\nI am looking for some advice on how to use git for a website with a lot of html content.\n\nWe have 2 content managers that do basic html coding and upload their work to the server. I am the only developer.\n\nThe site is pretty equally divided between 2 types of content. First is a news content that is posted to a database and displayed throughout the site. The other half of the content is in html. The site uses the templating system and all of the html pages are just the content portion of the page. The templating system adds the header, footer, and navigation. The site as a whole is about 3.5gb (we have a lot of pdfs and pictures).\n\nThe first question is if I dump all of it into git what will happen? I have a feeling it will be fine at first but as changes are made and the site grows will the git repo grow to the point of being unmanageable?\n\nSecond because of the templating system the content managers cant view their work on their local machines without a full web server setup. I would like to avoid this if posible. I have a test server in the office but I can't figure out how to get git gui to run on a local machine but reference files on the remote server. Simply running `git gui` over ssh returns an error and teaching them all of the git commands is not going to happen.\n\nAny suggestions would be a lot of help. We currently are not using any version control and it is a mess. People are constantly overwriting each others work and we don't have an easy way to move changes from a test server to the production server.",
