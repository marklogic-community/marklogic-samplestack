I have tried both synchronous and asynchronous searches and hit the problem both ways.\n\nYou are supposed to be able to work round this by setting a paging control on the search, but according to the python-ldap docs controls are not implemented yet for search_ext.  Is there a way to do this in Python?  If the python-ldap library does not support it, is there another Python library that does?",
