  "body": "\n\nSSMS 2008 comes with a great set of standard reports, including one named Schema Changes History. When I run this report, I see all schema changes made since a certain date. My question is this. How is the date determined? For example, on one database for a particular server, the changes are as of 2/14/2010 1:35:15 pm. But on another database on the same server, the changers are as of 1/5/2010 9:09:15 am. These are not the dates the databases were created.\n\nThanks.",
