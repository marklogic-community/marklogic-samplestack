Is a historical multiBarChart possible with nvd3.js? \n\nIf so, how do I configure it (I've tried various x-axis settings)? If not, is my best option to use separate historicalBarCharts, one for set set of data or is there another way to achieve this?", "lastActivityDate":"2014-01-02T02:14:08.333", "title":"nvd3.js How to make a historical multiBarChart?", "tags":["javascript", "d3.js", "nvd3.js"], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
