  "body": "\n\nI have multiple, labeled sets of data with dates on the x-axis and integers on the y-axis that I am stacking using nvd3.js's multiBarChart.\n\nBecause the x-axis data is sparse (there is a fixed interval between dates, but not all dates have data), the x-axis puts each stacked bar side-by-side instead of preserving the relative distance in time/date between the data points on the x-axis.\n\nI would like to have the x-axis preserve its time/date spacing like the historicalBarChart. Is a historical multiBarChart possible with nvd3.js? \n\nIf so, how do I configure it (I've tried various x-axis settings)? If not, is my best option to use separate historicalBarCharts, one for set set of data or is there another way to achieve this?",
