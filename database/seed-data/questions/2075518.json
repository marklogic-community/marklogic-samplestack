I've included it this way:\n\ninclude_once '../classes/zend/library/zend/date/DateObject.php';\n$date = new Zend_Date(time());\n\nHere's the error: Fatal error: Class 'Zend_Date' not found\n\nDo I have to go through the steps to change the configuration files for apache, and php just to use this one class?\n\nAny help is appreciated.  Thanks.",
