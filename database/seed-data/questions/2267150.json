  "body": "\n\nHey guys having a strange problem basically all is fine in good old ff however ie7 is crying like a little baby and throwing the above error - char: 3, 'Undefined' is null or not an object .\n\nI am splitting a string into a format I need to compare with another string. Once I have split the string I split it further - example below :\n\n\t    noteDate = $(xml).find('entry:first published').text();\n\t    // split string to get the date - saved in realDate\n\t    var dateCheck = noteDate.split(\"T\");\n\t    var realDate = dateCheck[0];\n\t    var timeCheck = dateCheck[1]; \n\t    var lastSplit = timeCheck.substring(0, timeCheck.length-1);\n\t    var fullFeedDT = (realDate + \" \" + lastSplit); \n\t\n\nIE7 is currently moaning about the forth line however I have a feeling the problem may be with line 3 - due to the fact the error has 3 characters (char: 3).\n\nIf anyone can spot a problem please let me know would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCheers ",
