  "body": "\n\nI am using the ObservableSortedDictionary from Dr. WPF.\n\nThe constructor looks like this:\n\n\tpublic ObservableSortedDictionary(IComparer<DictionaryEntry> comparer)\n\t\n\nI am really struggling to create an implementation that satisfies the constructor and works.\n\nMy current code (that won't compile) is:\n\n\tpublic class TimeCreatedComparer<T> : IComparer<T> \n\t{\n\t    public int Compare(T x, T y)\n\t    {\n\t        var myclass1 = (IMyClass)((DictionaryEntry)x).Value;\n\t        var myclass2 = (IMyClass)((DictionaryEntry)y).Value;\n\t        return myclass1.TimeCreated.CompareTo(myclass2.TimeCreated);\n\t    }\n\t}\n\t\n\nIt says I can't cast from T to DictionaryEntry.\n\nIf I cast directly to IMyClass, it compiles, but I get a runtime error saying I can't cast from DictionaryEntry to IMyClass. At runtime, x and y are instances of DictionaryEntry, which each have the correct IMyClass as their Value.",
