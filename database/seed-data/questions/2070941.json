  "body": "\n\nI have decided to use the singleton pattern for my application. It makes the most sense to me. However, just when I feel like I have made some progress I run into another wall.\n\nI have a load function. The load function does the following.\n\nCheck if class has been previously loaded. \n- If so - return $class::get_instance();\n- Otherwise - look for class in various places - if found - return $class::get_instance(); - else return error.\n\nBefore adopting the Singleton pattern I was instantiating classes with the load class.\n\nIn the controller I would have this.\n\n\t$session = $this->load->library('session');\n\t\n\nThe load class would then find the file and return..\n\n\treturn new $class_name;\n\t\n\nI hoped that the in changing the method of loading classes it would be a tweak to a few lines but these tweaks are generating syntax errors.\n\n\treturn $class_name::get_instance();\n\t\n\nIs there a way to write the line above without the syntax error?",
