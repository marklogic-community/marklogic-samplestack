  "body": "\n\nAfter reading the documentation for MySQL Workbench I got the impression that it's possible to alter a database in the server (e.g. add a new column) and later incorporate the DDL changes into your EER diagram. At least, it has a *Synchronize Model* option in the *Database* menu. I found it a nice feature because I could use a graphic modelling tool without becoming its prisoner.\n\nIn practice, when I run such tool I'm offered these options:\n\n\tModel             Update  Source\n\t================  ======  ======\n\tmy_database_name  -->     ! N/A\n\t   my_table_name  -->     ! N/A\n\tN/A               -->     ! my_database_name\n\t   N/A            -->     ! my_table_name\n\t\n\nI can't really understand it, but leaving it as is I basically get:\n\n\tDROP SCHEMA my_database_name\n\tCREATE SCHEMA my_database_name\n\tCREATE TABLE my_table_name\n\t\n\nThis is a dump of the model that overwrites all remote changes in my_table_name. \n\nAm I misunderstanding the feature?",
