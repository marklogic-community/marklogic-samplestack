  "body": "\n\nThere is a static class Pipe, defined in C++ header that I'm including.\n\nThe static method I'm interested in calling (from Objective-c) is here:\n\n\tstatic ERC  SendUserGet(const UserId &_idUser,const GUID &_idStyle,const ZoneId &_idZone,const char *_pszMsg);\n\t\n\nI have access to an objetive-c data structure that appears to store a copy of userID, and zoneID -- it looks like:\n\n\t@interface DataBlock : NSObject\n\t{\n\t    GUID userID;\n\t    GUID zoneID;\n\t}\n\t\n\nLooked up the GUID def, and its a struct with a bunch of overloaded operators for equality. UserId and ZoneId from the first function signature are #typedef GUID\n\nNow when I try to call the method, no matter how I cast it (const UserId), (UserId), etc, I get the following linker error:\n\n\tLd build/Debug/Seeker.app/Contents/MacOS/Seeker normal i386\n\tcd /Users/josh/Development/project/Mac/Seeker\n\tsetenv MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.5\n\t/Developer/usr/bin/g++-4.2 -arch i386 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk -L/Users/josh/Development/TS/Mac/Seeker/build/Debug -L/Users/josh/Development/TS/Mac/Seeker/../../../debug -L/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin10/4.2.1 -F/Users/josh/Development/TS/Mac/Seeker/build/Debug -filelist /Users/josh/Development/TS/Mac/Seeker/build/Seeker.build/Debug/Seeker.build/Objects-normal/i386/Seeker.LinkFileList -mmacosx-version-min=10.5 -framework Cocoa -framework WebKit -lSAPI -lSPL -o /Users/josh/Development/TS/Mac/Seeker/build/Debug/Seeker.app/Contents/MacOS/Seeker\n\t\n\tUndefined symbols:\n\t  \"SocPipe::SendUserGet(_GUID const&, _GUID const&, _GUID const&, char const*)\", referenced from:\n\t  -[PeoplePaneController clickGet:] in PeoplePaneController.o\n\tld: symbol(s) not found\n\tcollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n\t\n\nIs this a type/function signature error, or truly some sort of linker error? I have the headers where all these types and static classes are defined #imported -- I tried #include too, just in case, since I'm already stumbling :P\n\nForgive me, I come from a web tech background, so this c-style memory management and immutability stuff is super hazy.\n\nEdit: Added full linker error text. Changed \"function\" to \"method.\" Also I'll note that we're using a custom makefile to compile a few projects external to this one. SocPipe static methods are referenced elsewhere, though, in this xcode project and seems to compile fine.\n\nThanks,\nJosh",
