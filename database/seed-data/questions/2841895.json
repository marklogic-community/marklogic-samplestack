  "body": "\n\nI have a function which takes in a font (ttf or otf file) and generates an image of text in different fonts.\n\nThe problem I have is trying to work out how I can make the text fit in the image regardless of the font-size, type of font, and amount of text.\n\nI have tried to make the image rectangle variable so that it contains the text of different fonts without cutting a bit of the text since the image is not long or wide enough.\n\nHere is the function that I currently have, I have tried using the number of characters to determine the width of the image, but in some cases for some fonts and sizes, it still gets cut off.\n\n\tfunction generate_image($save_path, $text, $font_path){\n\t\n\t    $length = strlen($text) * 15;\n\t\n\t    // Create the image\n\t    $im = imagecreatetruecolor($length, 40);\n\t\n\t    $white = imagecolorallocate($im, 255, 255, 255);\n\t    $grey = imagecolorallocate($im, 128, 128, 128);\n\t    $black = imagecolorallocate($im, 0, 0, 0);\n\t\n\t    imagefilledrectangle($im, 0, 0, $length, 40, $white);\n\t\n\t    $font = $font_path;\n\t\n\t    imagettftext($im, 30, 0, 0, 25, $black, $font, $text);\n\t\n\t    if(imagepng($im, $save_path)){\n\t\n\t        $status = true;\n\t\n\t    }else{\n\t\n\t        $status = false;\n\t\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    imagedestroy($im);\n\t\n\t    return $status;\n\t\n\t}\n\t\n\nThank you all for any help",
