  "body": "\n\nWe have a large collection of MOSS 2007 sites that need a chunk of javascript added to them. I edited, checked in, published, and approved this change to default.master and the change is reflected on the root site, but none of the subsites.\n\nI'm a little nervous to use the \"Reset all subsites to inherit this Site Master Page setting\" in site settings since there are so many subsites, but I'm not sure if I have any other option? All of the subsites only show default.master in their master page gallery, but it's not the version I just modified.\n\nThanks! ",
