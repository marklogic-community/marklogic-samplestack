I am wondering if the length variable in arrays is defined as a constant and if so why it isn't in all capital letters LENGTH to make the code more understandable.\n\nEDIT: [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/arrays.doc.html#11358](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/arrays.doc.html#11358) found where it talks about array initialization and creation expressions thanks to @Yishai and @Lauri",
