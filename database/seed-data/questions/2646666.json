  "body": "\n\nI think I've been too much time looking at this function and just got stuck trying to figure out the nice clean way to do it.\n\nIt's a jQuery function that adds a click event to any `div` that has a `click` CSS class. When that `div.click` is clicked it redirects the user to the first link found in it.\n\n\tfunction clickabledivs() {\n\t    $('.click').each(\n\t        function (intIndex) {\n\t            $(this).bind(\"click\", function(){\n\t                window.location = $( \"#\"+$(this).attr('id')+\" a:first-child\" ).attr('href');\n\t            });\n\t        }\n\t    );\n\t}\n\t\n\nThe code simply works although I'm pretty sure there is a fairly better way to accomplish it, specially the selector I am using: `$( \"#\"+$(this).attr('id')+\" a:first-child\" )`. Everything looks long and slow. Any ideas? \n\nPlease let me know if you need more details. \nThanks!\n\nPS: I've found some really nice jQuery benchmarking reference from Project2k.de here: \n[http://blog.projekt2k.de/2010/01/benchmarking-jquery-1-4/](http://blog.projekt2k.de/2010/01/benchmarking-jquery-1-4/)",
