What i want is that when a user clicks in the jtextarea, (preferably single click), the entire line be highlighted, and this highlighted text be retrieved. \n\nEach line actually has an email of the form name@emailid.com. To select the entire text would require triple clicks. I want the email to be selected in a single click. Is this possible?",
