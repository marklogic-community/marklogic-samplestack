  "body": "\n\nI'm using an SSL certificate from geotrust. I just ordered and installed it this weekend.\nHowever when I try to access my website using https, firefox (and the other browsers as well) the browser warns that the certificate expired a few days ago.\n\nI guess there could be two reasons:\n1. I made a mistake during the installation of the certificate\n2. Geotrust did not sign the certificate properly.\n\nFirst I want to rule out the second reason considering my browser tells me the certificate expired a few days ago. This does not make sense at all.\n\nIs there a way to extract the expiration date from the certificate?\n\nThanks!",
