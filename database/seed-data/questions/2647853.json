  "body": "\n\nI want to use intelligent tabbing in Emacs in C++ mode, but I also want to be able to insert a tab character when necessary.  From other posts, I gather that the easiest way is to bind `<Ctrl>-<Tab>` to indent.  However, it appears that Konsole in KUbuntu won't forward the `<Ctrl>`?\n\nMy current .emacs file contains:\n\n\t(defun my-c-mode-common-hook ()  \n\t (setq c++-tab-always-indent t)\n\t (setq tab-width 4)\n\t (setq indent-tabs-mode t)\n\t )\n\t\n\t(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook)\n\t\n\t(global-set-key [C-tab] 'self-insert-command)\n\t\n\nSo I believe that this will bind `<Ctrl>-<Tab>` to inserting a tab character.  However, when I run:\n\n`<Ctrl>-h k <Ctrl>-<Tab>`\n\nEmacs only reports that I pressed the tab key.  Is there some option to Konsole (which I have searched through to no avail) or global preferences in KUbuntu that I need to set so that the `<Ctrl>-` is also forwarded?  (It certainly forwards all of the other `<Ctrl>-blah` commands.)",
