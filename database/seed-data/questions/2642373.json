  "body": "\n\nThis is a very very basic question and I know one way is to do the following:\n\n\tchar buffer[33];\n\titoa(aq_width, buffer,10);\n\t\n\nwhere aq_width is the int, but then I can't guarantee what size of buffer I would need in order to do this... I can always allocate a very large buffer size, but that wouldn't be very nice... any other pretty and simple way to do this?",
