  "body": "\n\nI've got an existing pom file that includes a maven-jar-plugin section. It runs for the test-jar goal and is currently excluding a few directories:\n\n\t<excludes>\n\t     <exclude>...</exclude>\n\t     <exclude>...</exclude>\n\t     <exclude>somedir/**</exclude>\n\t </excludes>\n\t\n\nI need to include a file in the somedir directory but leave out the rest of the files in the somedir directory. I've read that includes have precedence over excludes so I added something like the following (there was no includes section before):\n\n\t<includes>\n\t    <include>somedir/somefile.xml</include>\n\t</includes>\n\t\n\nThis ends up creating a jar file for test with only a few files in it (just the stuff in META-INF). The file that I included is not in the jar either. What I'd expect is a jar that is identical to the jar that was created before my includes change with the one additional file.\n\nWhat am I missing here?",
