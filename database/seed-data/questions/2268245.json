  "body": "\n\nI am stuck in implementing the following:\n1. User starts typing in a textbox.\n2. The javascript on page captures the first character typed, validates that it is an english alphabet (a-z,A-Z) and converts it to lowercase (if necessary).\n3. Make an XMLHttp request based on the input (i.e. if first input character is a, get a.xml, if b get b.xml and so on).\n\nI know how to do the last part (make the xmlhttp request) but am kind of stuck on how to capture the first character and validate it (in a way that works on all browsers). Please guide. Thanks.\n\n**Clarification**: This is to create a Google Suggest like autocomplete-drop-down menu without the need for server side programs.",
