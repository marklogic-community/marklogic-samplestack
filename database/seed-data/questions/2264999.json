  "body": "\n\nI have large amount of data been passed around in my application as byte[] objects. Which is also turing out to be memory problems in a lot of cases. What about if i wrap byte[] in a class like \n\n[Serializable]\npublic class MyClass\n{\n  public byte[] Data { get; set; }\n}\n\nDo you guys think i would gain any performance becoz now a reference type would be passed around rather a value type ,hence data doesnt have to be copied every time. \n\nLooking forward to your answers",
