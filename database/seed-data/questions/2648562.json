  "body": "\n\nThe problem is that I want to output Mathematica compatible floating point numbers. The only difference with the standard IOStream or printf output format is that the exponential `e` is replaced by `*^`:\n\n\tStandard C/C++ output format: 1.23e-4\n\tMathematica format: 1.23*^-4\n\t\n\nIs there a way to manipulate streams to achieve this effect? My original idea was just to use istringstream and dump it to a string and then replace all the `e`'s. I would also be okay if someone posted code to parse through the bits of the floating point number and output it directly (i.e. a `printf(\"%e\")` replacement).",
