Usually, with a .NET application, if you have an unhandled exception you get a nice error message with a stack trace.\n\nHowever, this time, I got a different dialog that just told me there was an error and offered to attach a Debugger, but there was no stack trace in the dialog and the machine it was running on had no debugger installed.\n\nWhat gives?  Why don't I see the default .NET exception handler?",
