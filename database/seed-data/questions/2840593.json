  "body": "\n\nIt takes about minute to achieve 3000 in my comp but I need to know the millionth number in the series. The definition is recursive so I cannot see any shortcuts except to calculate everything before the millionth number. How can you fast calculate millionth number in the series? \n\n**Series Def**\n\n`n_{i+1} = \\floor{ 3/2 * n_{i} }` and `n_{0}=2`.\n\nInterestingly, only one site list the series according to Google: [this one](http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/b061418.txt). \n\n**Too slow Bash code**\n\n\t#!/bin/bash\n\t\n\tfunction series \n\t{\n\t        n=$( echo \"3/2*$n\" | bc -l | tr '\\n' ' ' | sed -e 's@\\\\@@g' -e 's@ @@g' );\n\t                                        # bc gives \\ at very large numbers, sed-tr for it\n\t        n=$( echo $n/1 | bc )           #DUMMY FLOOR func\n\t}\n\t\n\tn=2\n\tnth=1\n\t\n\twhile [ true ]; #$nth -lt 500 ];\n\tdo\n\t        series $n                        # n gets new value in the function through global value\n\t        echo $nth $n\n\t        nth=$( echo $nth + 1 | bc )     #n++\n\tdone\n\t",
