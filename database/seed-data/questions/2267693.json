  "body": "\n\nWhat are some RESTful ways to transition between pages of a multi-page form in Django? \n\nMy current method:\n1. form POSTs to same page\n2. form view validates and stores POST data in session\n3. form view redirects to the next form page upon successful validation. \n4. next form checks if previous data exists. if not, redirects to first form. \n\nAre redirects between form pages bad? Should forms POST to the next form page? If so, where should form validation happen?",
