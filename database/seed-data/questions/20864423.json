  "body": "\n\nI've been looked around and have no luck on this.\n\nSo I have a complex query to sphinx and wondering if I could do complex query of SQL like this\n\n\tSELECT * FROM Table WHERE (categoryid in (17,18,19, 20) OR merchantid in (110,112,335)) AND brandid NOT in (20, 30, 40,50);\n\t\n\nI know OR is working with SetSelect with\n\n\t$s->SetSelect('*, IN(categoryid, 17,18 19) OR IN(merchantid,110,112, 335) AS test');\n\t$s->SetFilter('test', array(1), true);\n\t$s->query(\"\", \"index\");\n\t\n\nNOT query could be done as individual query \n\n\t$s->SetSelect('*, IN(brandid,20,30,40,50 AS nottest');\n\t$s->SetFilter('nottest', array(1));\n\t$s->query(\"\", \"index\");\n\t\n\nBut how should I combine both in one query",
