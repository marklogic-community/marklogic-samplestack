  "body": "\n\nI have read a lot about this issue but mine still seems to be different somehow.\nSo from what I understood, EXC_BAD_ACCESS occurs with memory management problems.\n\nThe thing is, mine does not seem (! :)) to be there. The thing is, I simple added a button in IB, rounded rect, no image. The I hooked it up with an IBACTION I defined in my class. This method does nothing (!) by the way.\n\nAnyway, as soon as I click the button, the App crashes, with \"EXC_BAD_ACCESS\".\n\nI am surely not overreleasing anything, as far as I can see, that is. What is wrong there?\n\nAny clues?\n\nThis is my console log:\n\n\tLoading program into debugger…\n\tsharedlibrary apply-load-rules all\n\tProgram loaded.\n\ttarget remote-mobile /tmp/.XcodeGDBRemote-148-79\n\tSwitching to remote-macosx protocol\n\tmem 0x1000 0x3fffffff cache\n\tmem 0x40000000 0xffffffff none\n\tmem 0x00000000 0x0fff none\n\trun\n\tRunning…\n\t[Switching to thread 11779]\n\t[Switching to thread 11779]\n\t(gdb) continue\n\t2010-01-15 09:16:34.800 FlightControl1[1899:207] Table loaded\n\t2010-01-15 09:16:35.200 FlightControl1[1899:207] 23\n\t2010-01-15 09:16:35.350 FlightControl1[1899:207] debug\n\tProgram received signal:  “EXC_BAD_ACCESS”.\n\t(gdb) \n\t\n\nThis is what I get, after I went up the stack:\n\n\t#0  0x31ec3ebc in objc_msgSend ()\n\t#1  0x33605784 in -[UIApplication sendAction:to:from:forEvent:] ()\n\t#2  0x336056ec in -[UIApplication sendAction:toTarget:fromSender:forEvent:] ()\n\t#3  0x336056b4 in -[UIControl sendAction:to:forEvent:] ()\n\t#4  0x3360530c in -[UIControl(Internal) _sendActionsForEvents:withEvent:] ()\n\t#5  0x33605f8c in -[UIControl touchesEnded:withEvent:] ()\n\t#6  0x335fd9ac in _UIGestureRecognizerUpdateObserver ()\n\t#7  0x30da1830 in __CFRunLoopDoObservers ()\n\t#8  0x30de9346 in CFRunLoopRunSpecific ()\n\t#9  0x30de8c1e in CFRunLoopRunInMode ()\n\t#10 0x332e7374 in GSEventRunModal ()\n\t#11 0x335adc30 in -[UIApplication _run] ()\n\t#12 0x335ac230 in UIApplicationMain ()\n\t#13 0x000027a8 in main (argc=1, argv=0x2ffff4d8) at /Users/SomePath/main.m:14\n\t",
