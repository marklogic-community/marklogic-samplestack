  "body": "\n\nI have a class B which inherits from A which in turn derives from `enabled_shared_from_this`. Now, I want to get a shared pointer to B from an instance of B. `shared_from_this` will return `shared_ptr<A>`, not `shared_ptr<B>`. Should I use `boost::static_pointer_cast` here? Or is there a better way?",
