  "body": "\n\nI was given the task of doing quality check on a machine translation xml file. The translations are from English to a foreign language. I have about 2000 translation blocks in the file and I have to check 200 of them by adding my remarks in the block enclosed in a < comment > tag with a quality attribute. Is there a linux command or some text editor out there which can count the number of comment tags I add or just the number of time the word '/comment' occurs so I don't have to keep track manually?
