  "body": "\n\nI'm trying to get a compile command (rake cucumber) to run with a specific ruby version on my Mac OS X system, I use rvm to do this currently in the terminal. My ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist has the correct path in it, but emacs insists on prepending to this path and therefore making it useless.  I've also tried:\n\n\t(when (equal system-type 'darwin)\n\t  (setenv \"PATH\" (concat \"/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/bin:/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.8.7-p249/bin:/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p249/bin:/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p249%global/bin:/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/bin\"))\n\t  (push \"/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/bin\" exec-path)\n\t  (push \"/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.8.7-p249/bin\" exec-path)\n\t  (push \"/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p249/bin\" exec-path)\n\t  (push \"/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p249%global/bin\" exec-path)\n\t  (push \"/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/bin\" exec-path))\n\t\n\nIt was the desperate attempt of an emacs beginner to get what I wanted.  It *still* prepends in front of it, so my path ends up being:\n\n\t/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/bin:/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.8.7-p249/bin:/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p249/bin:/Users/fearoffish/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p249%global/bin\n\t\n\nI don't want /usr/bin and others prepending, I want *my* path first and the emacs prepended path to be at the end, I reckon this would fix my problem.\n\nI test this by simply opening Aquamacs and running `meta-x compile` and then `echo $PATH`.\n\nAny ideas?",
