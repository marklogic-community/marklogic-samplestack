  "body": "\n\nI am working on a project that requires me to hop into to separate DB's.\n\nSo I have figured that I need to have multiple functions inside of my VB page.\n\nThe only problem I am having,is I am not to sure how to get this all accomplished.\n\nSo far I have figured out the overall structure, just need help implementing that structure.\n\nHere is my idea:\n\nThe main Function would call two other functions. We can Call them Sub Function 1 and Sub Function 2.\n\nSo, the main Function takes the saved sessions information for the E-mail address and dumps in into Sub Function 1. It needs to open up a new connection to the db/stored procedure and RUN the following procedure and then return the result. Here is the stored procedure and what i think is correct.\n\n\tCREATE PROCEDURE WEB_User\n\t(\n\t    @EMAIL_ADDRESS varchar(80) = [EMAIL_ADDRESS]\n\t)\n\tAS\n\tSELECT\n\t    MEMBER_NUMBER\n\tFROM\n\t    WEB_LOGIN\n\tWHERE\n\t    EMAIL_ADDRESS = @EMAIL_ADDRESS\n\t\n\nSo my question is, what is the function suppose to look like? how do I send the session information to the procedure? and finally, how do I return the stored procedure results and push back into the main function so it can be carried into sub function 2?\n\nThank you in advance for your help... I really appreciate it!",
