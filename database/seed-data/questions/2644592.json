([http://rogeralsing.com/2010/04/14/playing-with-plastic/](http://rogeralsing.com/2010/04/14/playing-with-plastic/))\n\nOne thing that really makes my mind bleed is \"generators\" and the \"yield\" keyword.\nI know C# uses AST transformation to transform enumerator methods into statemachines.\n\nBut how does it work in other languages?\nIs there any way to get generator support in a language w/o AST transformation?\ne.g. Does languages like Python or Ruby resort to AST transformations to solve this to?\n\n(The question is how generators are implemented under the hood in different languages, not how to write a generator in one of them)",
