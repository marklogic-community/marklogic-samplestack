  "body": "\n\nLet's say that I have an application frame, and I want to show a popup QCalendarWidget over on the right side of the frame.  Normally, QT will clip the edges of the QCalendarWidget, cutting it in half and not displaying the rest, as it would be over the right side border. \n\nIs there a way to work around this limitation without resorting to implementing a QDialog? \n\nI want the widget to be visible outside the bounds of it's container.
