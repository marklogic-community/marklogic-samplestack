  "body": "\n\nI'm attempting to override and implement my own TabExpansion. In the function I want to parse the contents of $psise.CurrentFile.Editor.Text when a certain $lastword criteria is matched. The issue I have is that the variable $psise.CurrentFile.Editor.Text is resolved to the contents of my TabExpansion function rather than whatever text is in a PowerShell ISE tab. \n\nHere's simple test function. Open an ISE tab and paste the following tabexpansion function definition:\n\n\tfunction tabexpansion\n\t{ $psise.CurrentFile.Editor.Text }\n\t\n\nRun the script in ISE. Next open another tab in ISE type some text and press the tab key\nThe output will be \n\n\tfunction tabexpansion\n\t{ $psise.CurrentFile.Editor.Text }\n\t\n\nRather than whatever text was in the second tab. Is there any way to get $psise.CurrentFile.Editor.Text to resolve at runtime when used within a tabexpansion function?",
