The question I have concerns the tab stops and `entab`. I figure that for `detab` it's pretty easy to determine the number of spaces needed to reach the next tab stop, so no worries there. With `entab`, replacing spaces with tabs is slightly more difficult since I cannot for sure know how large the tab character goes to its own tab stop (unless there is a way to know for sure).\n\nAm I even thinking about this thing properly?",
