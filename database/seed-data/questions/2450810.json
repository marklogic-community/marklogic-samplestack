  "body": "\n\nI basically have 7 select statements that I need to have the results output into separate columns.  Normally I would use a crosstab for this but I need a fast efficient way to go about this as there are over 7 billion rows in the table.  I am using the vertica database system.  Below is an example of my statements:\n\n\tSELECT COUNT(user_id) AS '20100101' FROM event_log_facts WHERE date_dim_id=20100101\n\tSELECT COUNT(user_id) AS '20100102' FROM event_log_facts WHERE date_dim_id=20100102\n\tSELECT COUNT(user_id) AS '20100103' FROM event_log_facts WHERE date_dim_id=20100103\n\tSELECT COUNT(user_id) AS '20100104' FROM event_log_facts WHERE date_dim_id=20100104\n\tSELECT COUNT(user_id) AS '20100105' FROM event_log_facts WHERE date_dim_id=20100105\n\tSELECT COUNT(user_id) AS '20100106' FROM event_log_facts WHERE date_dim_id=20100106\n\tSELECT COUNT(user_id) AS '20100107' FROM event_log_facts WHERE date_dim_id=20100107\n\t\n\nshould return something like:\n\n\t20100101 | 20100102 | 20100103 | 20100104 | 20100105 | 20100106 | 20100107\n\t1234     | 1234     | 36564    | 45465    | 356754   | 3455     | 4556675\n\t",
