  "body": "\n\nI want to know if there is a built-in BASH command that prints some text on stderr, just like the `echo` command that prints text on stdout. I don't want to use temporary io-redirection. I use a built-in command to generate an error on stderr such as `ls --asdf` (ls: unrecognized option '--asdf') but I want something neater.\n\nEdit ----\n\nActually I am trying to demonstrate stderr/stdout redirection, and my example looks like:\n\n\tsh test.sh >test-out.txt 2>test-err.txt\n\t\n\nFor clarity, I want to keep the test.sh file as simple and clean as possible, this means avoiding `>` operator inside the file.",
