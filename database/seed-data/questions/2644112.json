  "body": "\n\nI have an Java applications which I would like to run with different values of input parameters (specified in the command line). In \"Run -> Run Configurations\" I have created different configurations corresponding to different values of the input arguments.\n\nI can run these configurations in the same way (throw \"Run -> Run Configurations\"). But in these case I have to perform to many actions (clicks) to run a particular configuration. Is there a easier (faster) way to do that? For example I expect that I can do it throw \"Run -> Run as\" but in the drop-dawn menu of the \"Run as\" I see \"(Not Applicable)\".",
