  "body": "\n\nWhen you have sprint task in Scrum, where do you put how you want to program something?  For example, say I am making a tetris game and I want to build the part of the game that tracks the current score and a high score table.  I have my feature, my user story and my task, but now I want to talk about how to design it.\n\nIs that design something that is recorded on the sprint somewhere as to how to do that or is that just somethign the programmer figures out.  Do you put do task x use database such and such, create these columns, etc.?  If not, do you record that at all?  Is that what trac is for?  I don't mean too high level design.\n\nI touched on it here:  [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2009688/where-in-the-scrum-process-is-programming-architecture-discussed](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2009688/where-in-the-scrum-process-is-programming-architecture-discussed)\n\nbut my current question is later in the project after the infrastructure.  I'm speaking more about the middle now.  The actual typing in the code.  Some said they decide along the way, some team-leads.  Is this is even documented anywhere except in the code itself with docs and comments?\n\nedit:  does your boss just say, okay, you do this part, I don't care how?\n\nThank you.",
