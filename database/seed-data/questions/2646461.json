My googling led me to this post from Steve Mosely:\n[http://avingtonsolutions.com/blog/post/2010/04/03/JQuery-AspNet-MVC-2-Multi-Project-Areas-and-Other-News-Minutia.aspx](http://avingtonsolutions.com/blog/post/2010/04/03/JQuery-AspNet-MVC-2-Multi-Project-Areas-and-Other-News-Minutia.aspx)\n\n> So far the only hang up I had was that\n  I had set up my solution to\n  incorporate multi project areas which\n  was supported in the MVC 2 preview\n  releases of Areas. However, when the\n  RTM came out it was no longer\n  supported. I searched and searched for\n  solutions to my dilemma, but the only\n  thing I could find was post by\n  Jonathon who basically had the same\n  experience I had, and a reference to\n  an obscure message on a message board\n  saying (by what appeared to be some\n  one from the ASP Team) that it was not\n  supported. To date, I haven't found\n  any more formal post or article saying\n  that was not the case.\n\nIs this true?  Did this feature get removed from 2010 MVC2?  I haven't been able to find a definite answer.",
