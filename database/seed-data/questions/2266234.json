  "body": "\n\nI'm a python newbie, and I'm writing a script to copy compiled files from one location to another. What I have is quite simple at the moment, something like this:\n\n\timport os\n\timport shutil\n\t\n\tshutil.copy2 (src, dst)\n\t#... many more shutil.copy commands\n\t#src is a filename string\n\t#dst is the directory where the file is to be copied\n\t\n\nMy problem is that many of the files being copied are large files, and not all of them are re-compiled in every compile cycle. Ideally, I would like to copy only the changed files in this script. Is there any way I can do this? ",
