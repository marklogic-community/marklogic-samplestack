  "body": "\n\nI am using thick box 3.1 to load a pop up. It working well by using in the following way:\n\n\t<a href=\"filename.php\" class=\"thickbox\"> TEST </a>\n\t\n\nIf we click on the TEST now then the popup is working well and good.\n\nNow my prob is: I need to call this popup in form load using JavaScript.\n\nI do something like below:\n\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\n\twindow.location.href = \"filename.php\"    \n\t\n\t</script>\n\t\n\nit's just redirecting to that particular file. But not showing in the pop up.\n\nWhat is the possible way?\n\nthanks in advance",
