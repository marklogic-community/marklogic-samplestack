  "body": "\n\nBasically the default behavior of the horizontal axis of the line chart is to graph each plot \"as is\" for example if you had this data:\n\n\t<data value=\"5\">\n\t<data value=\"6\">\n\t<data value=\"7\">\n\t\n\nwould graph, `5|6|7`\n\nI would like to make it graph so that it is adding to a value as it goes horizontally so it would graph the numbers like this: `5|11|18` as each step it is adding the value. so first you have 5, then you have 5+6 = 11, then you have 11+7 = 18. So the graph is always going up (unless there is a negative value) as to show the growth over time. \n\nBut I would like this to be something that can be changed at runtime via a property like showGrowthOverTime = true.\n\nI am not even sure what I would need to extend LineChart? LinearAxis?\n\nThanks!!!",
