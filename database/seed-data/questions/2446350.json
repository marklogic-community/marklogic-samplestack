  "body": "\n\nI just built a Java OpenGL application in Eclipse... and when i was trying to export the application using EclipseP5Exporter, it requires me to initialize the window size (not viewport size, a window may contain several viewports).\n\nI already googled some solutions in the net but I can't seem to get anything useful..\n\nI've tried the method: `glutInitWindowSize(int width, int height);`\n\nbut it seems to work only in C and python openGL.\n\neven if i append the glut before the method (`glut.glutInitWindowSize()`) eclipse doesn't recognize that method..\n\nSo if you guys have any suggestions please let me know...\n\nThank you....",
