How can I accomplish this?\n\nCan I set the progress bar to a vertical mode? \n\nCan I use the slider control in a read only mode in which it id not adjustable? I was thinking I could simply set the slider to the actual value when the user attempted to modify it but that seems clunky.\n\nAny suggestions? ",
