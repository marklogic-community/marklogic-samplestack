  "body": "\n\nSo this question isn't about integrating an existing payment gateway into my site. This is more of a architectural question.\n\nI want to build a system similar to Paypal. Now I understand that Paypal offers a lot of features under the roof and I can't implement all of them at once. I want to implement the core functionality of Paypal and other such services.\n\nSo my question is (rather discussion is) around how would one go about building such a system. Some points to discuss:\n1. Handle payments through existing banks. I am guessing that I would need access to local bank protocols to get this.\n2. Allow users to securely store and process their payments\n3. How does Paypal handle the transactions?\n\nThoughts?",
