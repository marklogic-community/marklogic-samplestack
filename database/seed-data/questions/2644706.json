  "body": "\n\nHow do I set up a gem to have a binary command, e.g. \"project newProject\" that uses Thor's set of generator commands to create files, etc.?\n\nA good answer would describe how to lay out the skeleton of a gem that when run from the command line, i.e. \"project newProject\", creates one file named \"newProject.txt\" in the directory it's run from.\n\nI've seen that Rails 3 is using Thor to power its generators; seems like a really good solution and I'd like to use a similar approach in a non-Rails ruby gem I'm working on. Tried looking at the Rails 3 source but it's a bit labyrinthine, hence the question.",
