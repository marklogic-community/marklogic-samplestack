  "body": "\n\nI use MySQLdb a lot when dealing with my webserver. I often find myself repeating the lines: \n\n\trow = cursor.fetchone()\n\twhile row:\n\t    do_processing(row)\n\t    row = cursor.fetchone()\n\t\n\nSomehow this strikes me as somewhat un-pythonic. Is there a better, one-line way to accomplish the same thing, along the lines of inline assignment in C:\n\n\twhile (row = do_fetch()) { \n\t    do_processing(row); \n\t} \n\t\n\nI've tried figuring out the syntax using list comprehensions, but I can't seem to figure it out. Any recommendations? \n\nThanks,\n\nErik ",
