  "body": "\n\nI have a simple Windows App written in Visual Studio 2008 (.NET 3.0, C#).\n\nWithout making any change to the project, solution or Visual Studion (from what I can remember), something weird is happening: when I debug (or run) my application, when it hits an error, Visual Studio does not show me any messagebox with the error, and does not stop execution. It \"looks\" like nothing happended... the code after the error is not executed, but everything else continues to behave like nothing had happened.\n\nAny ideeas about what might be wrong? I don't think it's a big deal, but I can't seem to find it.\n\nThanks!   ",
