  "body": "\n\nI want to rotate a given 2D (!) Vector, is there a WPF built-in function for this?\nCurrently I'm doing it manually:\n\n\t        Vector v = new Vector();\n\t        v.X = 10; v.Y = 10;\n\t\n\t        Vector v2 = new Vector();\n\t\n\t        v2.X = v.X * Math.Cos(-90 * 180 / Math.PI) - v.Y * Math.Sin(-90 * 180 / Math.PI);\n\t        v2.Y = v.Y * Math.Cos(-90 * 180 / Math.PI) + v.X * Math.Sin(-90 * 180 / Math.PI);\n\t\n\nI think this should be also possible by multiplying the given vector with a rotation matrix? Anyways, I don't get it, can someone please give me an example? Thanks!",
