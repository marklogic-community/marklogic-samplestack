  "body": "\n\n(I tried to ask this question earlier today, but later realised I over-simplified the question; the answers I received were correct, but I couldn't use them because of my over-simplification of the problem in the original question.  Here's my 2nd attempt...)\n\nI have a data frame in R that looks like:\n\n\t\"Timestamp\", \"Source\", \"Target\", \"Length\", \"Content\"\n\t0.1        , P1      , P2      , 5       , \"ABCDE\"\n\t0.2        , P1      , P2      , 3       , \"HIJ\"\n\t0.4        , P1      , P2      , 4       , \"PQRS\"\n\t0.5        , P2      , P1      , 2       , \"ZY\"\n\t0.9        , P2      , P1      , 4       , \"SRQP\"\n\t1.1        , P1      , P2      , 1       , \"B\"\n\t1.6        , P1      , P2      , 3       , \"DEF\"\n\t2.0        , P2      , P1      , 3       , \"IJK\"\n\t...\n\t\n\nand I want to convert this to:\n\n\t\"StartTime\", \"EndTime\", \"Duration\", \"Source\", \"Target\", \"Length\", \"Content\"\n\t0.1        , 0.4      , 0.3       , P1      , P2      , 12      , \"ABCDEHIJPQRS\"\n\t0.5        , 0.9      , 0.4       , P2      , P1      , 6       , \"ZYSRQP\"\n\t1.1        , 1.6      , 0.5       , P1      , P2      , 4       , \"BDEF\"\n\t...\n\t\n\nTrying to put this into English, I want to group consecutive records with the same 'Source' and 'Target' together, then print out a single record per group showing the StartTime, EndTime & Duration (=EndTime-StartTime) for that group, along with the sum of the Lengths for that group, and a concatenation of the Content (which will all be strings) in that group.\n\nThe TimeOffset values will always increase throughout the data frame.\n\nI had a look at melt/recast and have a feeling that it could be used to solve the problem, but couldn't get my head around the documentation.  I suspect it's possible to do this within R, but I really don't know where to start. In a pinch I could export the data frame out and do it in e.g. Python, but I'd prefer to stay within R if possible.\n\nThanks in advance for any assistance you can provide",
