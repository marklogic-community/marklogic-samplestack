  "body": "\n\nI have stumbled upon a nice PHP library that uses GD to generate a reflection of a picture.\n\nI tried to modify the way so it also display the original image above its reflection to not have to align them in HTML.\n\nThe script can be found there :\n[http://reflection.corephp.co.uk/v3.php](http://reflection.corephp.co.uk/v3.php)\n\nAny idea if this can be done easily ? With my tests, the alpha gradient effect wasnt applied at all.\n\nThank you in advance.",
