I have tried echoing and printing some how it won't display the id or if I print it, then it will appear three rows of ids per rows like 111333444555, I just want to be able to have the id per row like echo $product['name'] does, each iteration only prints one row of the index [ 'name'].\n\nThe form below won't echo anything, and I I change it to print then it will print 111222333444 help..\n\n\t foreach($tree as $product){\n\t <form action=\"cart.php?id=\"'. echo $product['id']. '\">\n\t</form> \n\t<div> echo $product['name'] echo $procude['id']\n\t foreach($product['varieties'] as $variety) {\n\tetc etc \n\t</div> \n\t}\n\t}\n\t",
