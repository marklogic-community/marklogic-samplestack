  "body": "\n\nI'm using the HiLo generator in my S#rpArchitecture/NHibernate project and I'm performing a large import batch.\n\nI've read somewhere about the possibility to predict the Low values of any new records because they are generated on the client. I figure this means I can control the Low values myself or at least fetch the next Low value from somewhere.\n\nThe reason I want to use this is that I want to set relations to other entities I'm about to insert. They do not exist yet but will be inserted before the batch transaction completes.\n\nHowever, I cannot find information about how to set the Low values or how to get what Low value is up next.\n\nAny ideas?",
