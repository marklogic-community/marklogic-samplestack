It's somehow related to this [question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/546411/assign-unique-id-within-groups-of-records), but I would like to now if you would start off in databases with 0 or 1. Auto-incremental ids in sqlserver start off from 1, so my subjective opinion wouuld be to start off with 1. On the other hand, in most programming languages, indexes start off with 0. ",
