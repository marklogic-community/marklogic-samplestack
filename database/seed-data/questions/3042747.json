  "body": "\n\nI have a PHP script which calls another script in order to add IP addresses to a whitelist. I sometimes want to whitelist all addresses, in which case I have it call\n\n\texec(\"otherscript *.*.*.*\", output, retval);\n\t\n\nThis worked fine, adding the string \"*.*.*.*\" to the whitelist until I happened to have another file in the directory of the php script that matched that pattern (\"foo.1.tar.gz\"), at which point the wildcards were expanded, and I ended up with the filename in my whitelist. Is there some way to disable globbing in php's exec? It isn't mentioned in the PHP docs as far as I can tell.",
