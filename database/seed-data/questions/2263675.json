  "body": "\n\nI'm quite a begginer and I have two tables: \"product\" and \"product attributes\". \n\nHere's some imaginary data (the actual stuff involves more tables )\n\nProducts Table:\n\n\tproduct_id | product_name                  \n\t10         |   aaa                           \n\t11         |   bbb   \n\t12         |   ccc\n\t\n\nProduct Attributes Table:\n\n\tattribute_id | product_id\n\t      21     |    10         \n\t      23     |    10         \n\t      24     |    10         \n\t      21     |    11         \n\t      24     |    11         \n\t      21     |    12         \n\t      25     |    12         \n\t\n\nWhere each product has more than one possible attribute. I have a list of attribute ids like `(21,10,25)` and I need to select all products whose attributes are a subset of that list.\n\nIs it possible to do this in one query?\n\nWhen I filter for (21,24) desired output is to return only product 11 (bbb)\n\nWhen I filter for (21,23,24) desired output is to return products 10 and 11.\n\nWhen I filter for (21) desired output is to return none (because all products have at least one other attribute).",
