Thanks in advance, ell.\n\nEDIT:\nYeah, I tried renaming my class to MyWindow from Window to solve the problem but it didn't work, I forgot to rename the constructor. I have updated the code now but that still hasn't solved the problem. Here is the only other code I have in my project, I linked it because adding al those spaces would take a while: \n[ here's the code ](http://pastebin.com/uzQnX92w)",
