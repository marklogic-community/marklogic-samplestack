  "body": "\n\nI created a query for the zend framework, in which I try to retrieve the sum of a column, in this case the column named 'time'. This is the query I use:\n\n\t$this->timequery = $this->db_tasks->fetchAll($this->db_tasks->select()->from('tasks', 'SUM(time)')->where('projectnumber =' . $this->value_project));\n\t\n\t\n\t$this->view->sumtime = $this->timequery;\n\t\n\nEchoing the query tells me this is right. But I can't echo the result properly. Currently I'm using:\n\n\techo $this->sumtime['SUM(time)'];\n\t\n\nReturning the following error:\n\n\tCatchable fatal error: Object of class Zend_Db_Table_Row could not be converted to string in C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\BManagement\\application\\views\\scripts\\tasks\\index.phtml  on line 46\n\t\n\nLine 46 being the line with the echo in my view.\n\nI've been searching now for two days on how to figure this out, or achieve the same result in a different way. Tried to serialize the value, but that didn't work either.\n\nIs there somebody who knows how to achieve the total sum of a database column?\n\nAny help is greatly appriciated!\n\nnote: Pretty new to zend framework...",
