  "body": "\n\nI have a client who I'm trying to convince to implement Subversion (I know, I know).  My pitch goes something like this: His test domain is visible to Google and other webcrawlers, despite his best efforts (robot.txt not withstanding).  By putting the repository on an svn:// URL, we could avoid having the code crawled until the deployment to the live domain.\n\nMy question is: is there a way to deploy to a test domain, then bring it back down after work has been done.  I guess what I'm asking after is some means of switching the test domain on and off easily, and through Subversion or some tool in conjunction with Subversion.\n\nThis is more of a client-management issue, but y'all have never let me down.",
