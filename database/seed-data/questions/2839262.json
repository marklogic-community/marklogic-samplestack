  "body": "\n\nI'm doing some large integer computing, and I need to raise a BigInteger to the power of another BigInteger. The .pow() method does what I want, but takes an int value as an argument.  The .modPow method takes a BigInteger as an argument, but I do not want an answer congruent to  the value I'm trying to compute.\n\nMy BigInteger exponent is too large to be represented as an int, can someone suggest a way to work around this limitation?",
