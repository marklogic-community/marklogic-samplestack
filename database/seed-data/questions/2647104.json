  "body": "\n\nI'm creating a navigation controller based application.\nIn first view, there's a button. When clicked app will play a movie for 10 seconds.\nIn next view, there's another button. When clicked it will also play a movie.\nI'm using two different objects of MPMoviePlayerController in two views.\nBut my problem is that the movie is playing in first view and not in second view. The code that I used to play is same in both the views.\n\nWhat might be the problem?",
