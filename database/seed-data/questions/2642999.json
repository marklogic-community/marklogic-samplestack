  "body": "\n\nI am trying to decide on a data structure for an array that has a date for the key and the amount of bandwidth consumed as values.\n\nexamples\n\n\tKey       Consumed          Policy            \n\tOctober   50                 Basic\n\tNovember  75                 Basic\n\tDecember  100                Basic\n\t\n\nSome months, but not all, will have more than one policy. In that case, I need break them down by policy once the total is shown. So for the above example, assume December had 3 policies. The table i construct from my array would then need to show:\n\n\tKey       Consumed           Policy            \n\tOctober   50                 Basic\n\tNovember  75                 Basic\n\tDecember  100                ..\n\tDecember  25                 Basic\n\tDecember  25                 Extended\n\tDecember  50                 Premium\n\t\n\nCould all this data be represented in an array ? \n\n$myArray['december']  would be a different data structure than the others because it would need a last entry, probably another array, that had the policy names as keys and the amount of data consumed as values. Does PHP allow for arrays that are not structured uniformly? i.e. key october and November have only 2 entries under their key while December has 2 entries plus a 3rd which is an additional array.\n\nMy best guess is something like:\n\n\tArray (\n\t    [October] => \"50\", \"Basic\"\n\t    [November] => \"75\", \"Basic\"\n\t    [December] => \"100\", \"..\", Array( [Basic] => 25\n\t                                      [Extended] =>25\n\t                                      [Premium] => 50\n\t                                                     )\n\t       )\n\t\n\nMy question is if this is possible and how to declare it and populate it with values with PHP. Thanks in advance for any clarifications or assistance!",
