I want to add a linq result to the cache and then allow a mvc post to search the cache for better performance...every way I implement it I receive an object not referenced error...\n\nI'm confused, maybe I shouldn't be doing it this way but the mvc post will be checking up to 2000 records and it would seem best not to have it querying the database everytime.\n\nThanks for any help...",
