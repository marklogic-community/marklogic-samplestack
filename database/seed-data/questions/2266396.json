  "body": "\n\nIn UILabel there's functionality to truncate labels using different truncation techniques (UILineBreakMode). In NSString UIKit Additions there is a similar functionality for drawing strings.\n\nHowever, I found no way to access the actual truncated string. Is there any other way to get a truncated string based on the (graphical) width for a given font?\n\nI'd like to have a category on NSString with this method:\n\n\t-(NSString*)stringByTruncatingStringWithFont:(UIFont *)font forWidth:(CGFloat)width lineBreakMode:(UILineBreakMode)lineBreakMode\n\t",
