I tried to analyze, how many open files I have, and seems like not too much.\n\nBut when I executed  Process Explorer, I noticed that I have many open handles with similar names: \"\\Device\\NamedPipe\\Win32Pipes.00000590.000000e2\", \"\\Device\\NamedPipe\\Win32Pipes.00000590.000000e3\", etc. I see that the number of these handles is exactly equal to the number of the iterations that my program executed, before it returned \"Too many open files\" and stopped.\n\nI am looking for an answer, what are these handles, and could they actually cause the \"Too many open files\" error?\n\nIn my program I am loading files from remote drive, and I am creating TCP/IP connections. Could one of these operations create these handles?",
