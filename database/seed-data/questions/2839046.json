  "body": "\n\ni am writing a software that i have to drill down on content a lot. For example when the program starts a listview is displayed. When user clicks on an item, then a second listview must be displayed. For example:\n\nSelect Continent > Select Country > Select State > Select City > Select Address\n\n1. What is the best way to do this (less memory, faster, easier to code etc)? To create multiple listviews with multiple adapters? Or 1 listview with multiple Adapters? Lists are loaded from an external XML File.\n\n2. So far i am creating a new adapter and setting it to the listview. How do i create a second listview and after clicking on 1st listview displaying the second one, with animation. Any examples?\n\n3. Extend my class to ListActivity or Activity?",
