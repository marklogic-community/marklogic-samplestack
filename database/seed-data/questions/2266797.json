  "body": "\n\nIs it possible to apply (and remove) Windows group policy settings using .NET? \n\nI am working on an application that needs to *temporarily* put a machine into a restricted, kiosk-like state. One of the things I need to control is access to USB drives which I believe I can do through group policy. I'd like my app to set the policy when it starts and revert the change when it exits... is this something I can do through .NET framework calls?\n\n**These are my primary requirements:**\n* Apply group policy settings when my console app is started.\n* Identify when a user action is denied by the policy and log it.\n\n* Logging to the system security log is acceptable.\n* Revert my policy changes when my app stops.
