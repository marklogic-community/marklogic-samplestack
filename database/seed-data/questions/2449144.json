  "body": "\n\nI have gone through several plugins and I can't find a plugin that simply resizes and crops images to a specific size when they get uploaded. This is different from simply resizing one side of the image, I need it to resize the smallest side and then crop the largest side so that the image fits in a specific space. WP already does this by default with thumbnails but I need to do this with full-sized images as well. I was going to use: [http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/scissors/](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/scissors/) but it doesn't work with my installation. \n\nCan anyone think of another plugin that does this? Is there a simple way to enable this behavior for full size images by modifying wordpress? ",
