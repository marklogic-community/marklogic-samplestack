  "body": "\n\nThis may be a stupid question but im just starting to learn Rail thats why i am asking thsi question.\n\nI have one model called \"User\" which handles all the users in my community. Now i want to add a guestbook to every user. So i created a model called \"user_guestbook\" and inserted this into the new model:\n\n\tbelongs_to :user\n\t\n\nand this into the user model:\n\n\thas_one :user_guestbook, :as => :guestbook\n\t\n\nThe next thing i did was to add a new model to handle the posts inside the guestbook. I named it \"guestbook_posts\" and added this code into the new model:\n\n\tbelongs_to :user_guestbook\n\t\n\nAnd this into the user_guestbook model:\n\n\thas_many :guestbook_posts, :as => :posts\n\t\n\nWhat i wanted to achive was to be able to fetch all the posts to a certain user by:\n\n\t@user = User.find(1)\n\tputs @user.guestbook.posts\n\t\n\nBut it doesnt work for me. I dont know what i am doing wrong and if there is any easier way to do this please tell me so.\n\nJust to note, i have created some migrations for it to as follows:\n\ncreate_user_guestbook:\n\n\t  t.integer :user_id\n\t\n\ncreate_guestbook_posts:\n\n\t  t.integer :guestbook_id\n\t  t.integer :from_user\n\t  t.string :post\n\t\n\nThanks in advance!",
