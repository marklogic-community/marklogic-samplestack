  "body": "\n\nI have an issue where I have a partial view that returns some HTML to be displayed. Its called when something is clicked on the page using jquery. The problem is that no matter how I call it, i get back an empty string even though it reports success. This is happening to me using Chrome, going against my local machine.\n\nMy controller looks like this:\n\n\tpublic ActionResult MyPartialView()\n\t{\n\t    return PartialView(model);\n\t}\n\t\n\nI have tried jquery using .get(), .post() and .load() and all have the same results. Here is an example using .post():\n\n\t$.post(url, function (data)\n\t{\n\t    alert(data);\n\t});\n\t\n\nThe result always comes back as an empty string. I can navigate to the partial view in the browser manually and i get back the desired HTML. The URL I am using to call it I resolved fully so it looks like \"http://localhost/controller/mypartialview\" rather than using the relative path of \"/controller/mypartialview\" which I thought was the original problem. Any idea what may cause this?",
