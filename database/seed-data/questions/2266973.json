  "body": "\n\nI have a mediaOutput tag which, in its createContent attribute, requires the backing bean to be in a certain state. A list of values, which is filled in an init method, must be available.\n\nI therefore added a keepAlive tag for the whole backing bean. I now indeed see the backingBean in stead of some (richfaces) proxy bean, but the filled list is null again.\n\nHow to make this possible?\n\nI checked that the init method was called and that the list is filled in in the init method.\n\n\t<a4j:keepAlive beanName=\"myBean\" />\n\t<a4j:mediaOutput createContent=\"#{myBean.writeChart}\" ... />\n\t\n\nThe backing bean\n\n\tpublic class MyBean implements Serializable {\n\t\n\tpublic List list;\n\t\n\tpublic void init(ActionEvent event) {\n\t   // call some resource to fill the list\n\t   list = service.getItems();\n\t}\n\t\n\tpublic void writeChart(final OutputStream out, final Object data) throws IOException {\n\t   // list is null\n\t}\n\t\n\t// getters & setters\n\t}\n\t",
