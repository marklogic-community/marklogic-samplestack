Initially, you'll note, there are commas in the numbers being added. So that the function will add them, they are removed. How do I add the commas back in there?\n\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t    function sumOfColumns(tableID, columnIndex, hasHeader) {\n\t        var tot = 0;\n\t        $(\"#\" + tableID + \" tr\" + (hasHeader ? \":gt(0)\" : \"\"))\n\t          .children(\"td:nth-child(\" + columnIndex + \")\")\n\t          .each(function() {\n\t              tot += parseInt($(this).html().replace(',', ''));\n\t          });\n\t        return \"Total Pounds Entered : \" + tot;\n\t    }\n\t</script>\n\t",
