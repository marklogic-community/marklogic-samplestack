I'll be downloading it if it does exist, and if it doesn't then I'll do something else.\n\nI've done some searching on the intertubes and apparently there used to be a function called DoesExist or something similar... but as with so many of the Azure APIs, this no longer seems to be there (or if it is, has a very cleverly disguised name).",
