  "body": "\n\nI am a newbie to selenium webdriver. I am currently testing Search functionality in my project. I have written some code that navigates to the page, enters some data (that is retrieved from excel sheet) in the search field and submits the query.\n\nNow, because there is a sample data of 1000 items that the search functionality has to run through.. how can I perform verification if the returned result (filtered results) is correct?\n\nDo I have to write my own search function or do I keep a store of expected results on another excel sheet and compare with the search query result?.. \n\nPlease help.\nThank you.",
