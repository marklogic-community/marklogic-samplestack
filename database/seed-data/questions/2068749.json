  "body": "\n\nThe infinity (`∞`) symbol gets converted to `âˆž` when it is inserted into my MySQL table by a PHP script, but if I insert it directly from phpMyAdmin, it inserts correctly.  The symbol is passed to the PHP script by a GET call with the JavaScript function `encodeURIComponent()` around the contents.  The field in the MySQL database is `utf8_swedish_cl`.  How do I get `∞` to insert as `∞` into the database?",
