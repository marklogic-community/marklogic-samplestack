Howhever, when I run the application and that I look at my report, there is decimal on all of my numeric fields. How can I remove them?\n\nFor your information, when I right-click on one of these numeric field, I don't have a format option (probably because it comes from a DataSet and not directly from the DB, I can't tell exactly).\n\nThanks",
