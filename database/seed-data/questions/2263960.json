  "body": "\n\nI'm working on a module which uses a shared library, which in turn has a static library linked to it. The shared library build works fine and generates a .so. When I try to use it in the module, I get a variety of errors, most of which are based on stl (stl collections to be specific), at the compilation stage. The errors look like:\n\n\tIn file included from /usr/include/c++/4.3/list:68,                             \n\t                 from /home/gayan/LHIMo/LHI/src/CalcEngine/include/JuncNodeInfo.h:11,                                                                           \n\t                 from /home/gayan/LHIMo/LHI/src/CalcEngine/include/RiverFlowParameter.h:11,                                                                     \n\t                 from Main.cpp:11:                                              \n\t/usr/include/c++/4.3/bits/stl_list.h:465:11: error: macro \"catch\" requires 3 arguments, but only 1 given\n\t\n\nThis is given in most places which use list, vector or map.\nPlease help me to resolve this.\n\nSample code: \"CalcEngine.h\" in the library:\n\n\t#ifndef LHI_CALCENGINE_H_\n\t#define LHI_CALCENGINE_H_\n\t\n\textern \"C\"{\n\t#include <matrix2.h>\n\t}\n\t\n\tclass CalcEngine{\n\t\n\tpublic:\n\t\n\tprotected:\n\t\n\t};\n\t\n\t\n\t#endif /* LHI_CALCENGINE_H_ */\n\t\n\nMain.cpp in the application:\n\n\t#include <iostream>\n\t#include <CalcEngine.h>\n\t#include <list>  // The compilation fails as soon as this is added\n\t\n\tint main(int argc, char** argv){\n\t\n\t    return -1;\n\t}\n\t\n\nI feel this has something to do with the matrix2.h file but could not pinpoint it. The file could be found [here](http://svn.osgeo.org/grass/grass-addons/imagery/i.spec.sam/matrix2.h)",
