(Namely, this article: [http://blogs.msdn.com/wpfsdk/archive/2007/04/16/how-do-i-programmatically-interact-with-template-generated-elements-part-ii.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/wpfsdk/archive/2007/04/16/how-do-i-programmatically-interact-with-template-generated-elements-part-ii.aspx))\n\nMy ItemsControl is bound to an observable collection, which can have items dynamically added to it.  \n\nWhen I add an item to the observable collection, the templated item renders properly in my itemscontrol, but I can't figure out how to access it.  My my observable colleciton changed code, I am trying to access information about.  I am using a custom DataTemplateSelector to return one of 3 different dataTemplates, based on the item's data in the collection.\n\nHere is an outline of my ItemsControl XAML:\n\n\t<ItemsControl Name=\"myItemsControl\" ItemTemplateSelector=\"{StaticResource myTempSelector}\">\n\t    <ItemsControl.Template>\n\t        <ControlTemplate TargetType=\"ItemsControl\">\n\t            <ItemsPresenter/>\n\t        </ControlTemplate>\n\t    </ItemsControl.Template>\n\t    <ItemsControl.ItemsPanel>\n\t        <ItemsPanelTemplate>\n\t            <StackPanel></StackPanel>   \n\t        </ItemsPanelTemplate>\n\t    </ItemsControl.ItemsPanel>\n\t\n\t    </ItemsControl>\n\t\n\nThe solutions I've seen suggest using `ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromItem(xxx)`\n\nIn this examples, they are always looking for information about a ListBox or ComboBox (which inherit from ContentControl).  However, when I call (in my code-behind) `myItemsControl.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromItem(xxx)`, I receive a ContentPresenter, rather than the ContentControl I expect.\n\nThen, when I try to access the ContentTemplate of this ContentPresenter, I get a null object exception.\n\nI have a hunch that the rest of my troubles descend from there. \n\nAll I want to do is find a textbox from the datatemplate in my newly created control, and give it focus.\n\nHelp! :-)",
