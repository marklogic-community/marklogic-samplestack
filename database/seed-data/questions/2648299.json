  "body": "\n\nI have been using `UIViewController`s and `initWithNibName` with much success, basically using them as a convenient way to design the view with Interface Builder.  Unfortunately I have built a hierarchy of views before noticing this line in the `UIViewController` documentation:\n\n> **Note:** You should not use view\n  controllers to manage views that fill\n  only a part of their window\n\nMy question is this:  Having a very simple NIB that only has a `UIView` in addition to the default First Responder and Owning Object, what is the simplest way to load the `UIView` into my code?\n\nI have not been able to get `loadNibNamed:owner:options:` to work at this point, but suspect the answer will involve it somehow.",
