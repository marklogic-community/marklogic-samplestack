  "body": "\n\nI am working with a Java framework that generates some (proxy) classes at runtime, using a custom ClassLoader. I would like to get for any such class that the custom ClassLoader returns from loadClass(..) the raw byte array that corresponds to this class. Is this possible? I know that if a class exists as a resource then you can use an input stream to load the class in binary format but how can I go about this if the class is generated at runtime?",
