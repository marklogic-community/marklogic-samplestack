  "body": "\n\nI have an abstract class which requires a delegate to function. I pass the delegate into the constructor. Now that I have a non default constructor I need to call the abstract class's constructors from the concrete class which means that I need to use MyBase.New(...). I have included a quick example below.\n\n\tPublic MustInherit Class BaseClass\n\t    Public Delegate Sub WorkMethod()\n\t    Private _Work As WorkMethod\n\t\n\t    Public Sub New(ByVal Work As WorkMethod)\n\t        Me._Work = WorkMethod\n\t    End Sub\n\tEnd Class\n\t\n\tPublic Class ConcreteClass\n\t    Public Sub New()\n\t        MyBase.New(AddressOf DoSomethingHere)\n\t    End Sub\n\t\n\t    Public Sub DoSomethingHere()\n\t        'Do some work here\n\t    End Sub\n\tEnd Class\n\t\n\nI have tried to do this but I keep getting the following error: \"Implicit reference to object under construction is not valid when calling another constructor\".\n\nCan I not do what I am trying to do above? I initially had the delegate setup in its own setter method. But then I am creating a deceptive API because it does require a point to a method to work properly.",
