  "body": "\n\nI identified a bug in my code which I hope to solve with minimal refactoring effort. This bug occurs in Chrome and Opera browsers.\nProblem:\n\n\tvar obj = {23:\"AA\",12:\"BB\"};\n\t//iterating through obj's properties\n\tfor(i in obj)\n\t  document.write(\"Key: \"+i +\" \"+\"Value: \"+obj[i]);\n\t\n\nOutput in FF,IE\nKey: 23 Value: AA\nKey: 12 Value: BB\n\nOutput in Opera and Chrome **(Wrong)**  \n\nKey: 12 Value BB  \n\nKey: 23 Value AA  \n\n\nI attempted to make an inverse ordered object like this\n\n\tvar obj1={\"AA\":23,\"BB\":12};\n\tfor(i in obj1)\n\t  document.write(\"Key: \"+obj[i] +\" \"+\"Value: \"+i);\n\t\n\nHowever the output is the same. Is there a way to get for all browser the same behaviour with small changes?",
