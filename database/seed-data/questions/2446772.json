  "body": "\n\nI have a Abc field in the database and I want to make sure that the user doesnot cross the limit of the field in database, therefore I use validation that would say \"You cannot enter more than 50 characters\".\n\nNow the question is that because the memory to store Chinese,Indic script and other such languages take more than 1 byte how would I validate the length.\n\nWhat happens right now is that user has input of 30 characters and he gets a display message saying \"You cannot enter more than 50 characters\".\n\nfor solution what I know is I can increase the size of the database or check the byte length but it doesn't seems to be a good Idea.\n\nWhat approach would you follow to get it done?",
