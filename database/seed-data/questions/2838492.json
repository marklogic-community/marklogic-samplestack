I feel the best way to do this would be with your standard GUI slider elements (a la [this](http://mthamilton.ucolick.org/techdocs/instruments/AO/images/hartmannSliders.jpg), but not so ugly). I just noticed that the DOM doesn't provide these, however... \n\nWhat's the best way to introduce sliders to a webpage? Is there a standard library that everybody uses? Should I just roll my own? Or should is there a different element I can use? Should I embed them in the canvas element somehow?",
