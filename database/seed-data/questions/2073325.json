  "body": "\n\nI'm building a plugin, and adding an entry to the context menu (right-click on a folder in the  project tree).\n\nSo far it works, following this tutorial:\n[http://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-JFaceWizards/index.html](http://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-JFaceWizards/index.html)\n\nThe problem is that it's adding my entry in the root of the context menu. Since my entry refers to a \"New XXX\" wizard, I want it to go to the \"New\" submenu.\n\nIt seems like I would have to set the correct locationURI or menuPath in my plugin.xml. However I can't find the locationURI or menuPath corresponding to that submenu. How can I find that?",
