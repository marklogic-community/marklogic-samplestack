  "body": "\n\nI want to create a web form which will allow the user to upload text/rtf files in UTF-8 having foreign language content using PHP and then execute a series of commands on it via the exec() function. After this processing I would be giving it back to the user as a download.\n\nI made rudimentary form in html with a file input form and submit button. and the PHP side has the following contents.\n\n\t$base_dir = './uploads';\n\t$cmd = \"mkdir -p \".$base_dir.' ; mv -v '.$_FILES['file']['tmp_name'].'$_/'.$_FILES['file']['name'].' ; /var/www/cgi-bin/test.awk'.'/var/www/html/uploads/'.$_FILES['file']['name'].'>'.'/var/www/html/uploads/'.$_FILES['file']['name'];\n\texec($cmd);\n\tprint '<a href=\"http://oceanfizz.usc.edu/uploads/'.$_FILES['file']['name'].'\">download file </a>';\n\t\n\nBut the problem is that the uploaded rtf files seem to have text changes mainly like \n\n> so \"Ã©  became \\'8e  abd so forth.\n\nI think it is a problem with the encoding\n\nCan someone suggest a fast and easy way to upload files to a server and get back processed files via the browser at the same time preserving the encoding and contents.",
