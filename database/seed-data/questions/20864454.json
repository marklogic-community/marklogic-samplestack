  "body": "\n\nI recently began working with Open GL 4.0 using the Redbook 8th edition. From the start of the morning until now I wasn't able to compile the 'HelloWorld' of OpenGL programs. \n\nI configured the dependencies, transferred file contents of freeGlut/GLEW/GLSL to the respective VC folder for my VS 2013 C++ IDE. I eventually became convinced that the catalyst for this breakdown of events happened because VS was referencing multiple lib files in different locations and the linker couldn't make heads- to tails of what it was referencing.\n\nHowever I realized another issue that I was naive/ignorant about. **Could I be having compiling issues not because of my dependency configuration but because I only have a built in chipset instead of a card and no MESA?**\n\nI don't know if my built-in chipset supports openGL 4.0\n\n*Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000*\n\nEDIT: My compiltation errors within VS 2013 give no 'clue' that its a hardware issue. All of them are LNK2005 issues.",
