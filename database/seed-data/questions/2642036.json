  "body": "\n\nI want to write text files with DOS/Windows line endings '\\r\\n' using python running on Linux. It seems to me that there must be a better way than manually putting a '\\r\\n' at the end of every line or using a line ending conversion utility. Ideally I would like to be able to do something like assign to os.linesep the separator that I want to use when writing the file. Or specify the line separator when I open the file.",
