  "body": "\n\nI've got an application (that is targetting .Net Framework 2.0) that is running on startup of the System, and I'm trying to get a NotifyIcon to display.\n\nWhen my program starts up when a user either Runs it normally or is started as a child process after the system has already logged on everything is fine.\n\nIf my application starts up as the system is performing an AutoLogon using POSReady2009 (basically XP with Single User set). Then the NotifyIcon never becomes active.\n\nIf you subsequently check (in a timer) the .Visible of the Icon at any point later it always reports that it is visible = true.\n\nIf you disable the SSDPSrv and restart the Computer, the Icon displays correctly.\nI have a sneaking suspicion this is related to .Net 3.5sp1 installed over the top of a .Net 2 system.\n\nIs there some process that I should be following to ensure that my NotifyIcon is always available to the user.\n\nI have setup `RegisterWindowMessage(\"TaskbarCreated\")` but I don't get this message called, except when you forcilbly Kill Explorer.exe and restart it. Even so, a NotifyIcon interally registers for these notifications anyway, so it shouldn't be required.\n\nI'm happy to stall the startup of my program, but once the program starts up, I expect that the icon shows correctly.\n\nIf there is a KB article that I cannot find detailing this I'd be happy with that too.
