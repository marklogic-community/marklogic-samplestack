When you mouseover the names of the suites, it should show a description by removing an 'active' class and applying it to the corresponding div, with the stylesheet setting display:none to inactive divs and display:block to actives.  The same method is being applied to the images and that works fine though.  Any help on this issue would be much appreciated!",
