  "body": "\n\nI need to write a VB.Net 2008 applet to go through all the fixed-drives looking for some files. If I put the code in ButtonClick(), the UI freezes until the code is done:\n\n\tPrivate Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click\n\t    'TODO Find way to avoid freezing UI while scanning fixed drives\n\t\n\t    Dim drive As DriveInfo\n\t    Dim filelist As Collections.ObjectModel.ReadOnlyCollection(Of String)\n\t    Dim filepath As String\n\t\n\t    For Each drive In DriveInfo.GetDrives()\n\t        If drive.DriveType = DriveType.Fixed Then\n\t            filelist = My.Computer.FileSystem.GetFiles(drive.ToString, FileIO.SearchOption.SearchAllSubDirectories, \"MyFiles.*\")\n\t            For Each filepath In filelist\n\t                'Do stuff\n\t            Next filepath\n\t        End If\n\t    Next drive\n\tEnd Sub\n\t\n\nGoogle returned information on a BackGroundWorker control: Is this the right/way to solve this issue?\nIf not, what solution would you recommend, possibly with a really simple example?\n\nFWIW, I read that Application.DoEvents() is a left-over from VBClassic and should be avoided.\n\nThank you.",
