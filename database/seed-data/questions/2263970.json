  "body": "\n\nI have the following tables:\n\n\tPROJECTS - project_id, name\n\tEMPLOYEES - employee_id, name\n\tSALARY - employee_id, date, per_hour\n\tHOURS - log_id, project_id, employee_id, date, num_hours\n\t\n\nI need to query how much a project is costing.  Problem is that Salary can vary.  For example, a person can get a raise.\n\nThe SALARY table logs the per_hour charge for an employee.  With every change in cost being recorded with its date.\n\nHow can I query this information to make sure that the the log from the HOURS table is always matched to the right entry from the SALARY table.  Right match being.. depending on the date of the hours log, get the row from the salary table with the highest date before the log's date.\n\nie.. if the work was performed on Feb 14th.  Get the row for this employee from the Salary table with the highest date.. but still before the 14th.\n\nThank you,",
