  "body": "\n\nThe Leaks Instrument in Xcode shows me an memory leak here. I have commented the affected line which Leaks is complaining about. But I see no error in my memory management...\n\n\t- (void)setupViewController {\n\t    MyViewController *myVC = [[MyViewController alloc] init];\n\t\n\t    UITabBarItem *tbi = [[UITabBarItem alloc] initWithTabBarSystemItem:UITabBarSystemItemDownloads tag:1];\n\t    myVC.tabBarItem = tbi; // LEAK: 128 bytes\n\t\n\t    self.myViewController = myVC;\n\t\n\t    [myVC release];\n\t    [tbi release];\n\t}\n\t\n\nI mean... tbi and myVC IS released at the end, and the alloc IS balanced. So what's wrong? I don't get it.",
