I would have just downloaded the first entry but I am afraid it would break my server or something if I don't have apache.  We use IIS only and I wouldn't want to break it somehow.  I don't even need a web or webdav front end.\n\nWhich one should I install on this page, please:\n\n[http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91](http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91)\n\nthank you for any help.\n\nedit:  thanks for information, but I am hoping to stay free with the \"regular\" subversion.  I plan on using TortoiseSVN for the client.\n\n<B>Edit:</B> Please use [http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html#windows](http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html#windows) if you need recent Windows binaries.",
