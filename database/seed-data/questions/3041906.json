  "body": "\n\nThis might be a silly question but it struck me, and here i ask.\n\n\t<?php\n\t  $x=\"Hi\";\n\t  $y=\" There\";\n\t  $z = $x.$y;\n\t  $a = \"$x$y\";\n\t  echo \"$z\".\"<br />\".\"$a\";\n\t?>\n\t\n\n`$z` uses the traditional concatenation operator provided by php and concatenates, conversely $a doesn't, \n\nMy questions:\n\n1. by not using the concatenation operator, does it effect the performance? \n\n2. If it doesn't why at all have the concatenation operator. \n\n3. Why have 2 modes of implementation when one does the work?",
