  "body": "\n\nI've got a Customer object with a Collection of CustomerContacts\n\n\tIEnumerable<CustomerContact> Contacts { get; set; }\n\t\n\nIn some other code I'm using Reflection and have the PropertyInfo of Contacts property\n\n\tvar contacts = propertyInfo.GetValue(customerObject, null);\n\t\n\nI know contacts has at least one object in it, but how do I get it out?  I don't want to Cast it to `IEnumerable<CustomerContact>` because I want to keep my reflection method dynamic.  I thought about calling FirstOrDefault() by reflection - but can't do that easily because its an extension method.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas?",
