  "body": "\n\nI need to sort a 2 dimensional array of doubles on multiple columns using either C or C++. Could someone point me to the algorithm that I should use or an existing library (perhaps boost?) that has this functionality?\n\nI have a feeling that writing a recursive function may be the way to go but I am too lazy to write out the algorithm or implement it myself if it has been done elsewhere. :-)\n\nThanks",
