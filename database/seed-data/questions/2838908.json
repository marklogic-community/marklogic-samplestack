  "body": "\n\nI think I am missing something while using the Authlogic gem w/ Rails. To set the stage I have multiple users and each user can create posts and comments. Upon the display of a post or comment I would like to give the user who created them the option to edit or destroy.\n\nI am successfully using the following code to hide and show elements based on if a user is logged in or not but can't seem to find out how to only show these links to the actual user who created them...not any user that is logged in. \n\n\t<% if current_user %>\n\t   <%= link_to 'Edit', edit_question_path(question) %> | \n\t   <%= link_to 'Destroy', question, :confirm => 'Are you sure?', :method => :delete %>\n\t<% else %>\n\t   <p>nothing to see here</p>\n\t<% end %>\n\t\n\nHere is the def of current_user located in the application controller in case I need to change something here. \n\n\tclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n\t\n\t  helper :all # include all helpers, all the time\n\t  protect_from_forgery # See ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection for details#  \n\t\n\t  helper_method :current_user\n\t\n\t  private\n\t\n\t  def current_user_session\n\t    return @current_user_session if defined?(@current_user_session)\n\t    @current_user_session = UserSession.find\n\t  end\n\t\n\t  def current_user\n\t    return @current_user if defined?(@current_user)\n\t    @current_user = current_user_session && current_user_session.record\n\t  end\n\tend\n\t",
