  "body": "\n\nI have a database full of simple note data, with columns for title, due date, priority, and details.  There is also a _id column PRIMARY KEY int.\n\nSay I have a note in the table already with some data filled and the rest null.  I also have a set of data that will fill all those fields.\n\nIs there a way that I can only write data to the fields that are NULL?\n\nI can't overwrite existing data, but I'd like to add data to NULL columns.\n\nI know the rowId of the target row.\n\nIf my target row had rowId of 5, I could do something like this:\n\n\tUPDATE SET duedate='some date', priority='2', details='some text' WHERE _id=5\n\t\n\nBut that would overwrite all the data in that row, and I don't want to lose any data that might be there.  How can I change this statement to avoid writing to non-null fields?",
