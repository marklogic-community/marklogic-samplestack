I've got a bug and I don't know how to identify the line where the bug appears.\n\nI can't debug it on my ide because it's a live version (all runs fine in local).\n\nI've got log which says:\no\n\n\trg.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:172)#012#011\n\t\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.Cglib2AopProxy$DynamicAdvisedInterceptor.intercept(Cglib2AopProxy.java:625)#012#011\n\t\n\tat com.mycompany.server.rpc.UserService$$EnhancerByCGLIB$$64ed2d4f.createAccount(<generated>)#012#011\n\t\n\tat com.mycompany.server.rpc.ServiceRPCImpl.createAccount(ServiceRPCImpl.java:309)\n\t\n\nMy problem is the third line. As the UserService object is handled by Spring, it becomes a proxy and I can't know the line of the bug.\n\nDo you know how to solve the problem ?\n\nThanks",
