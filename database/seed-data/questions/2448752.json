  "body": "\n\nI have a reference to the Microsoft Scripting Runtime (scrrun.dll) in one of my Access projects.  If I open the object browser in VBA (by pressing F2) and choose 'Scripting' from the library dropdown it shows me all of the properties, functions, etc. for the Scripting library.  If I choose one of these functions and then click on the help button (with the yellow question mark) it opens a help window with the title of 'Microsoft Visual Basic Help.'\n\nIt acts like it is unable to find the help file for this library.  I can manually find the help file on my computer at the following location: \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\VBA\\VBA6\\1033\\VBLR6.CHM\".  (Note: I have 64-bit Win 7, thus the '(x86)' in the Program Files folder name.)\n\nI tried copying the help file to the following locations with no luck:\n\"C:\\Windows\\Help\\VBLR6.CHM\"\n\"C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\VBLR6.CHM\"  (I believe SysWOW64 folder is the Win7 64-bit equivalent of C:\\Windows\\System32)\n\nI have had this same problem with other referenced libraries as well, so I'm looking for some kind of generic solution.  I'm hoping there is some way to specify a location for the help file of a particular reference, or something else along those lines.  I appreciate any ideas.",
