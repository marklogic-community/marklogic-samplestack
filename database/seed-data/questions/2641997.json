  "body": "\n\nA new colleague has just suggested using named HQL queries in Hibernate with annotations (i.e. @NamedQuery) instead of embedding HQL in our XxxxRepository classes. \n\nWhat I'd like to know is whether using the annotation provides any advantage except for centralising quueries?\n\nIn particular, is there some performances gain, for instance because the query is only parsed once when the class is loaded rather than every time the Repository method is executed?",
