  "body": "\n\nI'm currently exploring Broadcast Receivers and Broadcast Intent.  There are some aspects of the tutorials which are ambiguous to me.  To my knowledge this is how the process works.  I can broadcast an intent from my application and any receiver on the phone can act on that intent as long as the actions match.  I can register a broadcaster receiver on anything that extends Context and when I do so I must provide a filter which will allow the receiver to act on one or more intent actions.\n\nThe part which confuses me is defining a receiver via the manifest.  Must the name of said receiver match a class name?  Why should I ever define an intent filter with an action in the project manifest if I always have to provide another intent filter when I register my receiver in code?\n\nIf anyone has a good tutorial or example of the best way to use broadcast receivers and how I should define them I would appreciate it.",
