It's a very small in-house project that must run on a very important person's machine, which cannot be upgraded for a very good reason. =)\n\nThe 10.6 DVD doesn't seem to offer an option to install the 10.3 SDK, only 10.4+. I also can't seem to find it on Apples website.\n\nI found this tip about how to install it on 10.5, via the Xcode optional installs, but that doesn't seem to be the case for 10.6?\n    [http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/201508-10-3-9-sdk-with-xcode-2-5-on-leopard.html](http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/201508-10-3-9-sdk-with-xcode-2-5-on-leopard.html)\n\nIs it incompatible, or just not offered because it's so old? Must I use an earlier version of Xcode? Can I just try to install it via a <10.6 DVD?",
