  "body": "\n\nThe standard DLL entry point is called DllMain. The second param is DWORD `ul_reason_for_call`.\n\nI have looked up on the MSDN to find all the values this can have, the following are obvious:\n\n\tDLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:\n\tDLL_THREAD_ATTACH:\n\tDLL_THREAD_DETACH:\n\tDLL_PROCESS_DETACH:\n\t\n\nBut what about :\n\n\tDLL_PROCESS_VERIFIER\n\t\n\nWhen will the entry point be called with this flag and should I worry about it during 'normal' operation of the DLL?\n\nUPDATE: I only see `DLL_PROCESS_VERIFIER` in headers files from Visual Studio 2005, not 2008.",
