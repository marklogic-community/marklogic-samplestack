  "body": "\n\nI am running a jetspeed portal which contains various portlet applications and have come across an issue after a recent reinstall where some of the portlets will return \n\n> Cannot pass a null PortletDefinition\n  to a PortletEntity\n\nAny idea what is causing this issue? I investigated a bit and it seems that jetspeed runs a process when new portlets are added where it creates mappings in its DB (derby in my case). If this does not complete it seems to cause this problem. Is my assumption correct? If yes, how can I restart this process?\n\nMany thanks",
