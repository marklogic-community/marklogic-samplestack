  "body": "\n\nThe situation is simple. I have a datagrid that gets its data from a webservice.\n\nWhen data from the webservice is retrived it calls the following function:\n\n\tprivate function onListReg():void\n\t{\n\t    arrRegOld = WSAutoreg.list.lastResult as ArrayCollection;\n\t    arrReg = WSAutoreg.list.lastResult as ArrayCollection;\n\t\n\t    dgReg.dataProvider = autoreglist;\n\t}\n\t\n\ndgReg is the Datagrid. the arr variables are ArrayCollections defined like so:\n\n\tprivate var arrRegOld:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection;\n\t\n\t[Bindable]\n\tprivate var arrReg:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection;\n\t\n\nThe intent is when I hit a update button, it compares arrRegOld with arrReg and see if any values have changes. The problem is whenever I change values on the Datagrid it changes on both the dataProvider and on both ArrayCollections.\n\nDoes anyone know why is this happening? What should I do so that the binding applies only to one ArrayCollection?\n\nAppreciate any tip.\n - Mike",
