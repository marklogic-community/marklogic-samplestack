  "body": "\n\nIs it possible to have an enum change its value (from inside itself)? Maybe it's easier to understand what I mean with code:\n\n\tenum Rate {\n\t    VeryBad(1),\n\t    Bad(2),\n\t    Average(3),\n\t    Good(4),\n\t    Excellent(5);\n\t\n\t    private int rate;\n\t\n\t    private Rate(int rate) {\n\t        this.rate = rate;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t        public void increateRating() {\n\t            //is it possible to make the enum variable increase?\n\t            //this is, if right now this enum has as value Average, after calling this\n\t            //method to have it change to Good?\n\t       }\n\t}\n\t\n\nThis is want I wanna achieve:\n\n\tRate rate = Rate.Average;\n\tSystem.out.println(rate); //prints Average;\n\trate.increaseRating();\n\tSystem.out.println(rate); //prints Good\n\t\n\nThanks",
