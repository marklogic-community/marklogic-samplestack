  "body": "\n\nIn my Post.rb model, I have `default_scope :conditions => {:deleted => 'false'}`\n\nBut if I try to run `Post.find(:all, :conditions => \"deleted='false'\")`, it won't return anything.  It's as if the default_scope takes precedence over everything.  \n\nI want it so that when I do `Post.find()` it doesn't return deleted posts, but I'd also like to be able to access them if I need to.  What needs to be changed in either my query or my Rails model?  \n\nThanks.",
