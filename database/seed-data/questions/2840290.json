  "body": "\n\nI've looked quite a bit, but I haven't been able to find a good programmatic way to list the queues on a RabbitMQ server.\n\nThis is important because I need to clean up my queues and exchanges when I'm done with them.  I don't always have a good \"done\" event that can be used to trigger a cleanup, so I'd like to do it with more of a garbage collection model.  If I can list the queues, I can verify that the objects that they're related to shouldn't be producing more entries and clean them up.\n\nI know I can use `rabbitmqctl` to do it, but that needs elevated privileges.\n\nSince I haven't been able to find a way to list the queues programmatically, I've been keeping a list of names in the database.  That works, but it's ugly.",
