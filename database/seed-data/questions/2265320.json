  "body": "\n\nI want to attempt an MVC design for my little app.\n\nI have a normal Csharp class ViewBase which extends UserControl. It's a single .cs file.\n\nI have multiple classes that I want to extend ViewBase. These are actual UserControls so they have a code behind .cs file and a .xaml file.\n\nHowever, CSharp tells me that for these classes, their base class \"differs from declared in other parts\".\n\nIs what I want to do possible at all? What am I doing wrong?\n\nNote that I did not modify my XAML files, so they still use  tags.\n\nHere is the relevant code:\n\n\t// This gives the error in question and ViewBase is underlined\n\t// \"Base class of LoginView differs from declared in other parts\"\n\tpublic partial class LoginView : ViewBase {\n\t    public LoginView(Shell shell, ControllerBase controller) : base(shell, controller) {\n\t        InitializeComponent();\n\t    }\n\t}\n\t\n\t// This one is a single .cs file\n\tpublic abstract class ViewBase : UserControl {\n\t    public Shell Shell { get; set; }\n\t    public ControllerBase Controller { get; set; }\n\t\n\t    protected ViewBase(Shell shell, ControllerBase controller)\n\t    {\n\t        Shell = shell;\n\t        Controller = controller;\n\t    }\n\t}\n\t",
