  "body": "\n\nI've noticed that some libraries such as clojure-twitter use special vars (the ones intended for dynamic binding that are surrounded by asterisks) for oauth authentication. You save your authentication in a var and then use (with-oauth myauth ..). I think this is a very nice solution to this sort of problem, because you can rebind the *auth* var for each user of the application.\n\nI've taken a similar route in an email client I've been writing. I have a special var named *session* that I bind to a map with the current user's session, and user info, and there are various important functions that use information from that var. I wrote a macro, with-session to temporarily rebind it in the context of a set of forms passed to with-session. It turns out to be a pretty clean solution (to me).\n\nSo, my question is this: am I 'doin' it rite'? Is this a bad design decision, or is this one of the intended usages of special vars?",
