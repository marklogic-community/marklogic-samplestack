  "body": "\n\nAs part of my Installer, I am adding files to an existing COM+ package.  I have defined a ComPlusApplication underneath my Product element, which has the name set to a property - I then have a custom action which looks up that property - all good so far.\n\nWhen the installer adds the files, within the same component I have added a ComPlusAssembly which adds the assembly to the ComPlusApplication I defined above - this is also working correctly.\n\nWhen uninstalled however, I am receiving an error related to being unable to find the COM+ application, this is because I am not running my custom action to look up the name of the COM+ package.  Basically I do not want to remove my files or unregister the component package as part of the uninstallation process - How do I achieve this?\n\nI am using WiX 3.0 with VS2008.\n\nThanks",
