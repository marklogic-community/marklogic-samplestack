  "body": "\n\nI'm new to the Win32 API and the many new types begin to confuse me.\n\nSome functions take 1-2 `ints` and 3 `UINTS` as arguments. \n* Why can't they just use ints? What are UINTS?\n\nThen, there are those other types:\n\n\tDWORD LPCWSTR LPBOOL \n\t\n* Again, I think the \"primitive\" C types would be enough - why introduce 100 new types?\n\nThis one was a pain: `WCHAR*`\n\nI had to iterate through it and push_back every character to an std::string as there wasn't another way to convert it to one. Horrible.\n* Why `WCHAR`? Why reinvent the wheel? They could have just used `char*` instead, or?",
