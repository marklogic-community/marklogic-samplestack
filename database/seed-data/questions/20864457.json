  "body": "\n\nI have a ViewPager with pages of WebView. A page has a text field allowing the user to type in contents. I'd like to save the page's input text to a Java variable when moving between pages (by sliding forward/backward). \n\nUnfortunately, it seems onPageSelected only tells me the page number that is about to display, and not the page it came from, which means I can't tell which page I needed to save at the time when the user changes page.\n\nAny ideas? Many thanks in advance!  ",
