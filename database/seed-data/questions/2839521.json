I'd like to allow users to paste an image tag in their conversion pages (like AdWords), and whenever that image is requested, a conversion registers in my app. \n\n\trespond_to do |format|\n\t  if @conversion.save\n\t    flash[:notice] = 'Conversion was successfully created.'\n\t    format.html { redirect_to(@conversion) }\n\t    format.xml  { render :xml => @conversion, :status => :created, :location => @conversion }\n\t    format.js { render :json => @conversion, :status => :created }\n\t    format.gif { head :status => :ok }\n\t  else\n\t    format.html { render :action => \"new\" }\n\t    format.xml  { render :xml => @conversion.errors, :status => :unprocessable_entity }\n\t  end\n\tend    \n\t\n\nThis way, the browser gets a non-existent .gif image. Is there a better way to do this? ",
