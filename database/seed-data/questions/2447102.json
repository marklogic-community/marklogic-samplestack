  "body": "\n\nI have a case where I need to load bitmap from a resource dll and release handle to it. The update mechanism may update the dll, and having it open will fail overwriting it.\n\nSo lets say I have something like this:\n\n\tHINSTANCE hInst = LoadLibraryEx(resourceDll, NULL, LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE);\n\tHBITMAP hBitmap = LoadBitmap(hInst, \"some.bmp\")\n\tFreeLibrary(hInst);\n\t\n\nis it valid to use hBitmap after calling FreeLibrary ?\n\nThanks in advance.",
