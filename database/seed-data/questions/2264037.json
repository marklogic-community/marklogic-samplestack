  "body": "\n\nI have this code:\n\n\tfunction some_object(...) {\n\t   this.data = {...};\n\t\n\t   this.do_something = function(...) {\n\t      var arr = [...];\n\t\n\t      arr.sort(function (a, b) {\n\t         return this.data[a] - this.data[b];\n\t      });  \n\t   }\n\t}\n\t\n\nHowever it's not working I think because `this` cannot be accessed in `sort` - another `this` is seen there for some reason, not the `this` of enclosing outer object.\n\nWhat to do? thanks",
