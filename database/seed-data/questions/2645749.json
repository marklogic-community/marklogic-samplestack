  "body": "\n\nWhat is the easiest way to check if something is a list?\n\nA method `doSomething` has the parameters `a` and `b`. In the method, it will loop through the list `a` and do something. I'd like a way to make sure `a` is a `list`, before looping through - thus avoiding an error or the unfortunate circumstance of passing in a string then getting back a letter from each loop.\n\nThis question must have been asked before - however my googles failed me. Cheers.",
