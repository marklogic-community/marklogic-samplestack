  "body": "\n\nI'm using Mozilla Rhino to write a JavaScript server application. I would like to include the HttpClient classes in my project to easily access the web, but I can't figure out how to configure my Eclipse project to get Rhino to load the HttpClient JAR file.\n\nI have added `js.jar` (from Rhino) and `httpclient-4.0.1.jar` to my project's build path in Eclipse, and in my run configuration I have specified the Main class from Rhino's js.jar (which it finds), and in my JavaScript file I basically do this:\n\n\timportPackage(org.apache.http.client.methods);\n\tvar get = new HttpGet(\"<some url returning json data>\");\n\tget.execute();\n\tprint(get.getResponseBodyAsString());\n\t\n\nIt fails saying this:\n\n\tException in thread \"Thread-0\" org.mozilla.javascript.EcmaError: ReferenceError: \"HttpGet\" is not defined.\n\t\n\nHow can this be so hard? I must be doing something fundamentally wrong.",
