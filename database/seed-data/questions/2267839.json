  "body": "\n\nLets pretend we have a /Cart/Checkout view that lists every Product in the Cart, plus a TextBox with the Quantity (in my real world application I have more than Quantity). How would you update the Quantity? I have used the following code, but I'am looking for a \"cleaner\" way of doing it.\n\nView\n\n\t<% int i = 0; foreach(var product in Model.Products) { %>\n\t<p>\n\t    <%= Html.Encode(product.Name) %>\n\t    <%= Html.TextBox(\"Quantity[\" + i + \"]\", product.Quantity) %>\n\t</p>\n\t<% i++; } >\n\t\n\nController\n\n\t[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]\n\t// This would be a better way, but it does not work, any ideas?\n\t//public ActionResult Checkout([Bind(Include = \"ProductID, Quantity\")] Product[] products)\n\tpublic ActionResult Checkout(int[] productID, int[] Quantity)\n\t{\n\t    // Get the Product from cartRepository, update Quantity and SaveChanges().\n\t}\n\t\n\nHow would you solve it?",
