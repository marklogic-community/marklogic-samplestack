The sender just gives the `ToolStripMenuItem` reference, which has an Owner property that references the `ContextMenuStrip`, but I cannot figure out how to tell which control the click came from.  There must be a simple way to check this, right?  I'm checking it in the `ToolStripMenuItem`'s click event.\n\n\tFriend WithEvents mnuWebCopy As System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem\n\t...\n\tPrivate Sub mnuWebCopy_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles mnuWebCopy.Click\n\t\n\nI found a [similar post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/244002/vb-net-desktop-context-menu-assigned-to-multiple-controls-owner-problem) about this, but that mentions using a `SourceControl` property which I do not see on here.  \n\nI'm using Visual Studio 2008, VB.Net winforms.",
