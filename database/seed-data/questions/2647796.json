  "body": "\n\nRight now my implementation returns the thing by value. The member m_MyObj itself is not const - it's value changes depending on what the user selects with a Combo Box. I am no C++ guru, but I want to do this right. If I simply stick a `&` in front of `GetChosenSourceSystem` in both decl. and impl., I get one sort of compiler error. If I do one but not another - another error. If I do `return &m_MyObj;`. I will not list the errors here for now, unless there is a strong demand for it. I assume that an experienced C++ coder can tell what is going on here. I could omit constness or reference, but I want to make it tight and learn in the process as well.\n\nThanks!\n\n\t// In header file\n\tMyObj GetChosenThingy() const;\n\t\n\t// In Implementation file.\n\tMyObj MyDlg::GetChosenThingy() const\n\t{\n\t    return m_MyObj;\n\t}\n\t",
