  "body": "\n\nI've been reading through some of guides on database optimization and best practices and a lot of them suggest not using boolean flags at all in the DB schema (ex [http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Top10SQLPerformanceTips](http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Top10SQLPerformanceTips)). However, they never provide any reason as to why this is bad. Is it a peformance issue? is it hard to index or query properly?\n\nFurthermore, if boolean flags are bad, what should you use to store boolean values in a database? Is it better to store boolean flags as an integer and use a bitmask? This seems like it would be less readable.",
