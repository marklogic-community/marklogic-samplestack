AutoIt or AutoHotKey or something else?\n\nI need to develop some small software for which I think using some professional suite like Visual Studio will be overkill. Most of the macro recording tools like AutoIt or AutoHotKey provide enough power to write decent application. Plus they are small and free.\n\nWhich option will be good? Using one of these tools or using some other small/free compiler?",
