  "body": "\n\nI've got a solution with two projects, `A` and `B`. `A` references an external dll `C.dll` from an external `/lib` folder.\n\nWhen I build `B`, `C.dll` is ending up in its `/bin` folder. \n\n`B` does not reference `A` or `C.dll` (but `A` does reference `B`).\n\nThere is no mention (reference) to/of `C.dll` anywhere in project `B`, why is it in its `/bin`? How can I determine where its coming from?\n\nUpdate: Using .NET 3.5\n\nThanks",
