In `MainActivity` I successfully connect to service (using a class that implements `ServiceConnection` + `bindService()` + `startService()`) but when I try to apply same method in other activity I see in LogCat a error:  \n\n\t01-15 22:29:37.438: ERROR/ActivityThread(12206): android.app.ServiceConnectionLeaked:  \n\t    Activity com.app.liviu.simpleMusicPlayer.PlaylistActivity has leaked ServiceConnection  \n\t    com.app.liviu.simpleMusicPlayer.PlaylistActivity$CounterServiceConnection@43713c90  \n\t    that was originally bound here.\n\t\n\nIs it possible to connect to a service in an other way: something like to make static my `CounterServiceConnection` object in `MainActivity` and use it in the second one?",
