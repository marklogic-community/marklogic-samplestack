  "body": "\n\ni have two points in 3D space which have X-coordinates with different signum. so one of them lies definitely on one side of the X-plane and one on the other.\n\nnow i want to find the intersection of this plane and the line made up by the two points in the most simple and optimized way.\n\ni know how to do general line plane intersection, but since in this case the plane is just the x-plane, i think there should be some shortcuts i can take.\n\nthanks!",
