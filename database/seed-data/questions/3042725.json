  "body": "\n\nI wanted to know if anyone here knows how to import a 3D Object (i.e. Maya 3D Model) into Adobe Flex Application? I needed to create a simple Flex application which will allow me to rotate the 3D Object by dragging but I cannot seem to start doing it because I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how I can import my 3D model into Flex.\n\nThis is exactly what I wanted to do: [3D Object in Flex](http://flexarena.blogspot.com/2006/10/3d-wireframe-renderer-for-flex.html)\n\nI hope someone can help me. Thanks a lot :)",
