  "body": "\n\nWell basically I may want to execute a script that may take as much as 1 hours as well.\n\nWhat I really want to do is Send SMS to my users using a third party API. So its basically like I supply my script with an array of phone numbers and fire the method to send SMS.\n\nHowever assuming it take 5 seconds to send 1 SMS and I want to send 1000 SMS which is roughly 1 - 2 hours. I can't use `set_time_limit()` because I am on shared host.\n\nOne way to do this is store numbers in a session and execute each SMS and use javascript to refresh that page until end. This way I need to keep my browser open and the execution will stop if my Internet Connection is disconnected.\n\nSo, Is there any better way to do this ?\n\nHope I am clear enough to explain what I want? I want to execute a large script that may take hours to execute without getting timeout.",
