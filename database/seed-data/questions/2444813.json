  "body": "\n\nQ1 - When doing a compile/debug is VS suppose to delete existing files in the bin\\debug area?  (for VS2008)\n\nif no then can I ask please:\n\nQ2 - My winforms checks for existance of a sqlite.db3 file and creates it if it needs to (programmatically).  If the behavior I wanted was that each Compile/Debug I do is for the target Debug area to be clear, so that the program would exercise the code that builds the database file, how would I organise this?\n\nthanks",
