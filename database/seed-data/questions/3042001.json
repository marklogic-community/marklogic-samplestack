I really want to create an identical workstation so I can test locally and then update my remote server. If anyone has any suggestions or solutions other than converting to linux, I would really appreciate it.\n\n\t<?php\n\t\n\t$safe_path = escapeshellarg('fake-virus.txt');\n\t\n\t$command = '/usr/bin/clamscan --stdout ' . $safe_path;\n\t\n\t$out = '';\n\t\n\t$int = -1;\n\t\n\texec($command, $out, $int);\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\techo $int;\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tif ($int == 0) {\n\t\n\t    // all good;\n\t\n\t} else {\n\t\n\t    echo 'o no';// VIRUS!;\n\t\n\t}\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t?>\n\t",
