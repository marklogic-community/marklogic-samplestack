  "body": "\n\nAfter reading [\"Using your signals\"](http://www.pygtk.org/articles/subclassing-gobject/sub-classing-gobject-in-python.htm) I am wondering if it is possible to connect the signals to \"sinks\" in an \"anonymous\" way?\n\nIn order words, if the example following (snippet from reference above):\n\n\taCar = Car()\n\taCar.connect('engine-started', myCallback) \n\t\n\nIs it possible just to connect `myCallback` to all the signal `engine-started` sources in one go?  Something along the lines of:\n\n`gbus.connect('engine-started', myCallback)`\n\nOf course `gbus` here is just an example.",
