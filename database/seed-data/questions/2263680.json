  "body": "\n\nThis might be simple but I'm starting out with rails. \n\nI have the following statement:\n\n\t@subjects = Cartitem.find_by_cid(session[:customerid])\n\t\n\nIn my View I have some code like this:\n\n\t<% @subjects.each do |d| %>\n\t <tbody>\n\t  <tr>\n\t\n\nAll works when when the above query returns multiple rows. However, when above query returns only one row then I get an error in my View saying method `each` is not defined. \n\nWhat is the way to avoid this? Do I need to have some `if/else` in my view?",
