  "body": "\n\nHope my subject line was descriptive enough.\n\nBasically, I have a table called Students, and one called Absences. The Students table contains student information (Name, DOB, StudentID etc.), the Absences table contains any absences (Date, Reason, related by StudentID). I want to get a full list of the students, plus a count of their absences.\n\nSample results would be:\n\n<pre>\nStudentName    Absences\n-------------  -----------\nJohnny         3\nMark           2\nJames          1\nAnthony        0\nSharon         0\n</pre>\n\nCan someone suggest a way I should tackle this problem?\n\nI would prefer to have a single SQL statement, possibly incorporating some views etc.\n\nThanks, \n\nJacob.",
