  "body": "\n\nI have  the following code to parse a String variable called str.\n\n\tNumberFormat formatter = NumberFormat.getInstance();\n\tNumber number = formatter.parse(str);\n\t\n\nI want to catch the Exception thrown when str is not a number just to validate it. The problem I have is that it does't always throws the ParseException expected. When the String str starts with a number but then are characters it seems to get a the first characters of the String and parse them as a number.\n\nFor example:\n* if str=\"a10\" then is thrown a ParseException\n* if str=\"10a\" then no exception thrown and number=10\n\nI cannot use Double.parseDouble(str) because str can have commas and points like 1,000.98 and this format is not understood by this method.\n\nWhy is this happening? Can I validate it in any other way? \nThanks",
