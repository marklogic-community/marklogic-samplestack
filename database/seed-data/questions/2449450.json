  "body": "\n\nI'm developing a game using XNA and C# and was attempting to avoid calling `new struct()` type code each frame as I thought it would freak the GC out. \"But wait,\" I said to myself, \"struct is a value type. The GC shouldn't get called then, right?\" Well, that's why I'm asking here.\n\nI only have a very vague idea of what happens to value types. If I create a new struct within a function call, is the struct being created on the stack? Will it simply get pushed and popped and performance not take a hit? Further, would there be some memory limit or performance implications if, say, I need to create many instances in a single call?\n\nTake, for instance, this code:\n\n\tspriteBatch.Draw(tex, new Rectangle(x, y, width, height), Color.White);\n\t\n\nRectangle in this case is a struct. What happens when that new Rectangle is created? What are the implications of having to repeat that line many times (say, thousands of times)? Is this Rectangle created, a copy sent to the Draw method, and then discarded (meaning no memory getting eaten up the more Draw is called in that manner in the same function)?\n\nP.S. I know this may be pre-mature optimization, but I'm mostly curious and wish to have a better understanding of what is happening.",
