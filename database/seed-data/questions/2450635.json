  "body": "\n\nI have a script (or more accurately WILL have a script) that checks a folder and copies a file from this folder to a different location (will run once per day).  The fileName that I'd like to copy from, however, changes based on the date.\n\nBasically, instead of setting the \"strFilePath\" to \"C:\\somePath\\somePath2\\myFile.txt\" I would like to simply take the most recently modified (or added - does this make a difference in terms of the script??) in the \"somePath2\" folder and copy it to the destination.\n\nBonus (but not completely necessary) would be to check in the script if the file was modified/added in the last 24 hours and only copy it over in that case.\n\nThanks for your help!",
