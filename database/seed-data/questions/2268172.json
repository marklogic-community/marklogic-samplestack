Now i have two git repositories A and B, A which is a project and B which is the CMS itself. Now i want to get B into A, but when i do this i get alot of merge-conflicts and the solution for the conflicts is always to use the stuff from B. Now what i think i need is git merge  -s recursive theirs  because i want to merge and when their is a merge conflict it should be forced to use the solution from B. But i can't get it to work. it always keeps telling me \"fatal: 'theirs' does not point to a commit\"\n\ndoes anyone know what i do wrong? the recursive theirs i found [here](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html)\n\ngreets,\nDaan",
