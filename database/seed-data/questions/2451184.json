  "body": "\n\nI've got a HashSet with a bunch of (you guessed it) integers in it. I want to turn it into an array, but calling\n\n\thashset.toArray();\n\t\n\nreturns an array of Object type. This is fine, but is there a better way to cast it to an array of int, other than iterating through every element manually? A method I want to pass it to\n\n\tvoid doSomething(int[] arr)\n\t\n\nWon't accept the Object[] array, even if I try casting it like \n\n\tdoSomething((int[]) hashSet.toArray());\n\t",
