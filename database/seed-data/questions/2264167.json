  "body": "\n\nThe way jQuery's `.clone()` seems to work, once you insert a cloned object somewhere, you cannot insert it again another time without re-cloning the original object. For example, if you do this:  \n\n\n\tvar cloned = $('#elem1').clone();\n\t$('#elem2').after(cloned);\n\t$('#elem2').after(cloned);\n\t\n\nOnly one copy of `elem1` will get copied and the second `after` call would have done nothing.  \n\n\nIs there a way to not \"clear the clipboard\" after using a cloned object? Right now I am making do by cloning the object again before inserting it somewhere. Is there a better way to do this?",
