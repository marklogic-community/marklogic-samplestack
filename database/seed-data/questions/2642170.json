Maybe I am missing it, but it seems like there is a shortcut in VS2010 to scratch your tail with one click but commenting out HTML code is still awkward as hell.\n\nWhat's the easiest way to get a function like this working?\n\nCan I expect any add-ins that were written for older versions of VS to work in VS2010 w/o an upgrade?",
