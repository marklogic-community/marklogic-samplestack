  "body": "\n\nI have a performance problem on a query. \n\nFirst table is a Customer table which has millions records in it. Customer table has a column of email address and some other information about customer.\n\nSecond table is a CommunicationInfo table which contains just Email addresses. \n\nAnd What I want in here is; how many times the email address in CommunicationInfo table repeats in Customers table. What could be the the most performer query.\n\nThe basic query that I can explain this situation is;\n\n\tSelect ci.Email, count(*) from Customer c left join \n\tCommunicationInfo ci on c.Email1 = ci.Email or c.Email2 = ci.Email \n\tGroup by ci.Email\n\t\n\nBut sure, it takes about 5, 6 minutes in execution.\n\nThanks in Advance.",
