I'm not using @import for loading, so it's not a case a FOUC.\n\nThe website is using Wordpress but never had an issue like this before with WP.\n\nI might be missing out on something stupid here, can find the problem though.\n\nAny help, suggestion would be very much appreciated.\n\nThe website is: [http://www.magashegyiturak.ro](http://www.magashegyiturak.ro)",
