  "body": "\n\nA colleague once said that God is killing a kitten every time I write a for-loop.\n\nWhen asked how to avoid for-loops, his answer was to use a functional language. However, if you are stuck with a non-functional language, say C#, what techniques are there to avoid for-loops or to get rid of them by refactoring? With lambda expressions and LINQ perhaps? If so, how?\n\n**Questions**\n\nSo the question boils down to:\n1. Why are for-loops bad? Or, in what context are for-loops to avoid and why?\n2. Can you provide C# code examples of how it looks before, i.e. with a loop, and afterwards without a loop?",
