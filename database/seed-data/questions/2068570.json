  "body": "\n\nI need to create a class with exactly the same methods as `java.lang.String`.\n\nWhat is the best way to do this in Java? \n\nI know that I can't extend String class as it is `final`. I am not looking at solutions where I need to copy the source code of `java.lang.String`. For example, assume that I need the functionality `length()` within my custom class named `MyString`, which has a corresponding 'myLength()` method.\n\nWhat is the best way to implement `myLength()`?\n\nI am not looking at various algorithms to find out the length of a string but to reuse `String`'s `length()` method. Now once I have `MyString` class ready, I should be able to use it anywhere for my custom manipulations.",
