  "body": "\n\nFirefox is one browser without which i cant even think of developing web application. This comes with so many handy add on and features which makes developers life easy.\n\nHowever features that Firefox has are huge and not every one is aware about them. So i request you all to add unique features/Add on of Firefox which are/will be helpful for developer.\n\n1. Firebug added then press <b>Ctr + Shift + F </b> :   \n\nLike very simple that i know is when firebug is added to Firefox \npress <b>Ctr + Shift + F </b>it gives you cross arrow and yellow dash board clicking any element on screen gives all the information about the element in very nice way.\n\n2. Tamper Data : Good add on for analyzing the HTTP request and response\n\n3. Capture Fox : Add on that helps to create the screen cast in simple way.\n\n4. UrlParams : Add on helps to observe the GET and POST parameters sent from the page.\n\nThanks,",
