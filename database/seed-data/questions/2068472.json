  "body": "\n\nI have a WSE 3.0 based web service, and a WinForms client application that makes use of the types defined in that service's References.cs, but subclasses them to provide some additional functionality required by the client.\n\nHowever, when I pass an instance of the subclass back to the web service, even though I explicitly cast back to the original type, I get the dreaded:\n\n*Use the XmlInclude or SoapInclude attribute to specify types that are not known statically.*\n\nin reference to my derived type.\n\nCode summary:\n\n\tpublic class DefinedInReferenceCs\n\t{ \n\t    // ... \n\t}\n\t\n\tpublic class ClientSubclass : DefinedInReferenceCs\n\t{\n\t    // My extra stuff\n\t}\n\t\n\tpublic class MyClient\n\t{\n\t    public CallTheWebService(ClientSubclass  obj)\n\t    {\n\t        // obj is an instance of ClientSubclass,  cast as DefinedInReferenceCs\n\t        svc.MyMethod((DefinedInReferenceCs)obj); \n\t        // Throws an exception complaining that ClientSubclass is not statically known\n\t    }\n\t}\n\t\n\nI can get around this by explicitly creating a DefinedInReferenceCs instance and performing a deep copy of the relevant fields.  Is there a better way?",
