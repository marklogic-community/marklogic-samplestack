  "body": "\n\nI've created an Outlook 2007 AddIn that among other things has to perform some  actions when user creates a new email. I've hooked to proper events and everything works correctly in all but one case.\n\nThe problem is that if Outlook is not running and user clicks `mailto` URL then Outlook opens only one explorer where user can compose the email. The other parts of the app are not loaded at that time. The problem is that in this case my plugin is not loading so I cannot add my custom code there.\n\nI'd like to know if there's a way to overcome this problem. \n\nI see two possible solutions but I don't know if they are possible.\n* Make plugin load on mailto links (one explorer mode). I suspected this would be provided out-of-the-box by VSTO but it's not. I couldn't find anything about that on MSDN nor MS Outlook Programming book.\n* Change mailto URL handler on client machine to launch full Outlook (like you would click Outlook shortcut) instead of just one Explorer. This would load my plugin before opening email explorer and would probably work as I intended.\n\nDoes anyone knows if any of that solutions is possible? Or maybe you have another that might work.",
