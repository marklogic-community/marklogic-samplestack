  "body": "\n\nDoes anyone know how I would go about changing (transforming) an image based on the input from the Microphone on the iPhone?\n\ni.e. When a user speaks into the Mic, the image will pulse or skew.\n\n[edit] Anyone have any ideas, I have (what is basically) a voice recording app. I just wanted something to change as the voice input is provided. I've seen it in a sample project, but that wasn't with an UIImage. [/edit]\n\nThanking you!!",
