I have a very simple question:\n\nI have a long string of content in php.I would like to convert all places where it says:\n\n\thttp://www.example.com/en/rest-of-url\n\t\n\nto\n\n\thttp://en.example.com/rest-of-url\n\t\n\nCould somebody help me with this? I think I use preg_replace for this?\n\nBonus: If you have a link to a good site which explains how to do the simplest things like this in regex, please post it. Every regex resource I look at gets very complicated very fast (even the Wikipedia article).",
