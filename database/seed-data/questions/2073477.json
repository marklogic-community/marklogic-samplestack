  "body": "\n\nThere are a couple of threads talking about license issue. Mostly focusing on GPL/LGPL/BSD. I am trying to use RabbitMQ in commercial applications, which is licensed under Mozilla Public License(MPL). Is MPL friendly to commercial use?\n\nI found a different question on Stack Overflow, and one of the comments mentions:\n\n> MPL: people can take your code, modify it, but if they distribute the modifications, they need to make sure modifications are publicly available for 3 years.\n\nIf I don't touch the source code at all, but only use the .jar files in my code, do I need to license my code under MPL as well?",
