  "body": "\n\nSo I'm trying to merge many excel files and .csv files in one directory into one .csv file. I use the following code:\n\n\t> echo off\n\t> \n\t> copy /a *.* merged.csv\n\t> \n\t> end\n\t\n\nAnd it works just fine but when it merges the files it does it in an alphabetical order which is inconvenient for me. Is there a way to merge them in the order that they were last modified? And if this is not possible, is it at least possible to create a batch file that takes all the names of the files and copies them into their first cell(the A1 cell)? Ex: If the file is named 01-01-2014.xls the name \"01-01-2014\" to appear in the A1 cell of the file(and this to be done for all the files in the directory). Note: The A1 cell is always empty(if it matters). Thank you very much in advance",
