  "body": "\n\nI am trying to create a test harness for our QA staff to test our \ninternal web services. I would like to create a web app that will \nallow them to enter a uri then submit. The web app will then \ninterrogate the uri to get the appropriate parameters expected and \nreturns with a generated input form. I know, this would be similar to \nSOAPUI and others. However, I feel it would be earier for them to be \nable to just use a form with entry fields and click a button to invoke \nthe service and get the results back for display in the web app. In \naddition, I could create some custom logic that allows them to \ngenerate specific behavior they need.\n\nHas anybody done anything like this? I have searched and have found \nsimilar functionality but nothing close enough to help me. If you need \nmore details please let me know.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance! \n\nRyan",
