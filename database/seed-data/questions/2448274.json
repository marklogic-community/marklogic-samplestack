  "body": "\n\nI have quite a few dictionaries where the key is a composite of several different values (mostly strings and integers). Do I implement these keys as classes (and override `GetHashCode()`, `Equals()` etc) or do I use `struct` instead? \n\nReSharper makes it easy to do the overriding, but the code looks horrible. Are there any performance implications of using a struct instead?",
