  "body": "\n\nI'm playing around with templates. I'm not trying to reinvent the std::vector, I'm trying to get a grasp of templateting in C++.\n\nCan I do the following?\n\n\ttemplate <typename T>\n\ttypedef struct{\n\t  size_t x;\n\t  T *ary;\n\t}array;\n\t\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is a basic templated version of:\n\n\ttypedef struct{\n\t  size_t x;\n\t  int *ary;\n\t}iArray;\n\t\n\nIt looks like it's working if I use a class instead of struct, so is it not possible with typedef structs?",
