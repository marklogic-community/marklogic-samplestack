  "body": "\n\nI am working on application which has counters running, now we need to stops those counters during breaks and outside shift hours.\nUsing SQL 2008. Currently I have following in SQL:\n1. Last Event Start Date and Event_Stop_Date/Current_Date (if event not stopped)\n2. Shift Table: SHIFT( ShiftID INT, Start_Time TIME(0), End_Time TIME(0))\n\n3. Break Table: BREAK(BreakID INT, Start_Time TIME(0), End_Time TIME(0))\n\n    \tData in SHIFT TABLE\n\t1   1st 07:20:00    15:20:00\n\t2   2nd 15:20:00    23:20:00\n\t3   3rd 23:20:00    07:20:00\n\t\n\tData in BREAK TABLE\n\t1   1st Shift - 1st break   09:10:00    09:25:00\n\t2   1st Shift - Lunch   11:30:00    12:05:00\n\t3   1st Shift - 2nd break   13:30:00    13:45:00\n\t4   2nd Shift - 1st break   17:10:00    17:25:00\n\t5   2nd Shift - Lunch   19:30:00    20:05:00\n\t6   2nd Shift - 2nd break   21:30:00    21:45:00\n\t7   3rd Shift - 1st break   01:10:00    01:25:00\n\t8   3rd Shift - Lunch   03:30:00    04:05:00\n\t9   3rd Shift - 2nd break   05:30:00    05:45:00\n\t\n\nI am thinking that by calculating the work time ((Event_Stop_Date/Current_Time - Last_Event_Start_Time)-(time outside shift hours + timebreak hours)) will help me on value to show on counter and if the current time is during shift and outside break hours counter will be running otherwise those will be stopped.\n\nI have tried to handle this in different ways with no luck. Can you please help me on SQL function which can return two values Work_hours between 2 dates passed and flag based on if end_datetime/ current_date_time is during work hours or not.\n\n\tCREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[Fnt_GetWorkTime]\n\t(   \n\t  @Start_Time DATETIME\n\t  ,@End_Time DATETIME\n\t)\n\tRETURNS @TableReturn TABLE \n\t  (\n\t    WorkTimeInSec INT,\n\t    CurrentTimeWorkTime BIT\n\t  )\n\t  RETURN;\n\t    END\n\t\n\nThanks in advance for help",
