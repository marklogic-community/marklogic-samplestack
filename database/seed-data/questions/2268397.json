  "body": "\n\nI know that Concrete Types can be configured with Structure Map the following way:\n\n\tForRequestedType<Rule>().TheDefault.Is.Object(new ColorRule(\"Green\"));\n\t\n\nThis works if you know the type ahead of time.  I want to do it at run time, and there does not seem to be a way.  Can some one enlighten me?  What I want to do is something like the following:  (This appears to be not supported by structure map)\n\n\tForRequestedType(typeof(Rule)).TheDefault.Is.Object(new ColorRule(\"Green\"));\n\t\n\nThe reason for this is because I'm working on a wrapper for structure-map's configuration.  And I will not know the type ahead of time.  For the .Object(new ColorRule(\"Green\")) I am going to be passing in a delegate instead, which would actually construct the object on request.",
