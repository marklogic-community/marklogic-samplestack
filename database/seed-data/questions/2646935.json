  "body": "\n\nFor some strange reason, the \\n and \\r escape sequences do not seem to be working in my code.  I want to write each NSString on a new line of the file, but it just appends it the last string on one line.  Here's the code:\n\n\tfor (Entry *entry in self.entries) {\n\t    NSString *path = @\"/Users/me/File.txt\";\n\t    NSString *string = (@\"%@\\r\\n\", [entry thisEntry]);\n\t    NSFileHandle *fh = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForWritingAtPath:path];\n\t    [fh seekToEndOfFile];\n\t    [fh writeData:[string dataUsingEncoding:NSUnicodeStringEncoding]];\n\t    [fh closeFile];\n\t}\n\t\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Forgive me as I am new to Objective-C.",
