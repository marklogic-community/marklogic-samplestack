  "body": "\n\nI'm using my own database and forms authentication.\n\nThe database contains one table with users and second one with roles, that users are assigned to. \n\nThe question is: how to prepare the  section in web.config, so it allows acces to the folder only for users belonging to one of the roles?\n\nSecond question: \nUsing IIS configuration I can block direct access to all folders in the web directory. Let's say, that one of pages will contain links allowing to download files from those protected folders. If user is allowed to acces that site will he also be able to download that content?",
