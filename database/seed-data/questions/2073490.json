  "body": "\n\nI have an application that will support multiple sites. The site will be determined based on the url. \n\nFor example \n[http://myapp/site/abc123/](http://myapp/site/abc123/)...\nand\n[http://myapp/site/xyz123/](http://myapp/site/xyz123/)...\n\nThe site code will drive a lot of the functionality for example themes, available modules, etc...\n\nQuestions:\n\n1-)I need to validate the site code is valid and if it isn't, it should direct the user to an info page. I was looking at using [IRouteConstraint](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.routing.irouteconstraint.aspx), is this appropriate? Are there other/better options? \n\n2-)Any gotchas with this approach (using url to identify site)? Is there are better approach?\n\n**Solution**\n\nI ended up creating a Custom ActionFilter and check the sitecode in the OnActionExecuting event. That seems to work well and fit better than the IRouteConstraint.",
