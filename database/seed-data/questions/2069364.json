  "body": "\n\nI am attempting to get a list of dependable(consistent across requests) list of \"hidden\" constants in PHP(as in, the client-side won't know about it in most cases without hacking). \n\nSome of the things I am interested in is the following:\n1. `./configure` options.\n2. I would also like the very first `System` value in phpinfo.  \n3. The loaded PHP modules(as shown in the Apache section)\n4. The build date of PHP.\n5. Registered PHP streams\n6. Registered stream socket transports\n7. Registered stream filters\n\nHow can I get either just a portion of the phpinfo or get these values as a regular string? Note that it doesn't matter if there if markup included, but I don't want to parse the phpinfo as that just seems really slow and surely there is a better way.. ",
