  "body": "\n\nI'm working on a multi-threaded program where I have a number of worker threads performing tasks of unequal length.  I want to load-balance the tasks to ensure that they do roughly the same amount of work.  For each task T<sub>i</sub>  I have a number c<sub>i</sub>  which provides a good approximation to the amount of work that is required for that task.   \n\nI'm looking for an efficient (O(N) N = number of tasks or better) algorithm which will give me \"roughly\" a good load balance given the values of c<sub>i</sub>.  It doesn't have to be optimal, but I would like to be able to  have some theoretical bounds on how bad the resulting allocations are.\n\nAny ideas?",
