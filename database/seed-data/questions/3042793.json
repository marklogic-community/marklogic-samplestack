If someone creates a subgroup, it is making everyone who had access to the parent group now also have access to the subgroup.\n\nI've never made a stored procedure before, but this looks like it might be time. This call be probably be called very often. \n\nShould I be creating a procedure or will the performance be insignificant?",
