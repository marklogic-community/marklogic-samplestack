  "body": "\n\nI am aware of the differences between webforms and MVC, I am trying to determine in which environment I will feel most at home but yet not in over my head. \n\nI have been building web apps for 9 years in ColdFusion using an MVC design pattern. I am used to having full control over the rendered HTML & CSS as well as utilizing the jQuery library for my interfaces. Having a device like Viewstate to help me persist across trips to and from the server has not been a luxury with the exception of a feature in the frameworks I work with marshaling form and url scoped variables into an event object for me to use.\n\nAlthough I have been following ASP.Net for about a year I have not written any web apps with it yet. the .Net MVC path is appealing to me because it is more familiar to me but I am concerned that my lack of experience with the .net platform and c# may be an additional burden.\n\nSo I guess my question boils down to how much does C# and .Net platform experience or the lack there of contribute to either Webforms or MVC being the right choice?\n\nThe abstraction offered by Webforms seems like a better starting path for beginners but I have already determined that I am weary of viewstate and I do not like all the code generation of the controls used in Weboforms.",
