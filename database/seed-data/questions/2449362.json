  "body": "\n\nI have a YML file containing fixtures for a Rails model (Comment) which looks like this (pardon the formatting):\n\n> comment_a:\n   id: 1\n   text: 'foo'\n   visible: false\n\n> comment_b:\n   id: 2\n   text: 'bar'\n   visible: true\n\n> comment_c:\n   id: 3\n   text: 'baz'\n   visible: true\n\nI know that I can select an individual Comment fixture like so:\n\n> comments(:comment_a)\n\nIn one of my acceptance tests, I want to find all the Comments which have visible = true. How do I select a set of Comments that meet certain criteria so I can iterate over them afterwards?",
