  "body": "\n\nI'm trying to figure out how could I parse this string using \"`sstream`\" and C++ \n\nThe format of it is: \"string,int,int\".\n\nI need to be able to assign the first part of the string which contains an IP address to a std::string.\n\nHere is an example of this string:\n\n\tstd::string(\"127.0.0.1,12,324\");\n\t\n\nI would then need to obtain\n\n\tstring someString = \"127.0.0.1\";\n\tint aNumber = 12;\n\tint bNumber = 324;\n\t\n\nI will mention again that I can't use `boost` library, just `sstream` :-) \n\nThanks",
