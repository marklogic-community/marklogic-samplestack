  "body": "\n\nWhen I try and use code that makes use of the Enterprise Library Caching Block I get the following error:\n\nThe \"cachingConfiguration\" section is not available in the supplied configuration source.\n\nThe section is in my app.config file for that particular assembly though. If I copy the file into the unit test assembly that makes use of the afore mentioned code everything works. Is there any way that I can force it to use the app config that exists in the referenced library so I don't need to duplicate it in every assembly that makes use of it?",
