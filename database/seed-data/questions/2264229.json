  "body": "\n\nI'm looking for a way of integrating a WYSIWYG editor into my rails app so it will use Paperclip for Image / File uploads.\n\n**What I want is this:** User can use a WYSIWYG field to create some rich text. They can upload an image into this text but the image will be stored nicely in a DB (hopefully using something like Paperclip) instead of just being dumped in a folder on the server.\n\nCan this be done? I've spent a fair while trawling the net for solutions to this problem. The closest I've come is a very handy looking plugin: [http://github.com/galetahub/rails-ckeditor](http://github.com/galetahub/rails-ckeditor)\n\nHowever, the instructions are a bit vague and I got bogged down partway through the implementation.\n\nI don't care what WYSIWYG editor I use, my requirements are very simple. I'm also not totally set on Paperclip so if there's another way (using attachment_fu) I'm happy to consider that too.\n\nEdit:\nI'm also happy if I can integrate a WYSIWYG editor with Paperclip and just store the images in the file system. It doesn't have to be uploaded to the DB. Any takers now?",
