Whatever is present in this parameter will be output as a part of the HTML response.\n\nExample JSP code:\n\n\t<%= request.getParameter(\"content\") %>\n\t\n\nI know this is silly and it should be sanitized and so on, but my question is if an attacker can actually take advantage of this? The way I understand it you'd only change the content sent to yourself, so the only one an attacker could hurt is himself? Correct?",
