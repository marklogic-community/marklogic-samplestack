  "body": "\n\nIm trying to debug my first Silverligt 3 app.  I have it linked to a web project.  The problem is that if an exception occurs, I get a popup that tells me to choose a debugger, and after doing so says something like \"There is already a debugger attached\".  Im used to WinForms where, if an exception is thrown VS breaks at that point and shows me where it is thrown.  Is this type of behavior possible with Silverlight?",
