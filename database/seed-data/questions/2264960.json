  "body": "\n\nI am developing a small utility application emailafriend using Spring. The basic functionality is to email the current url to a friend. As of now I am using a fixed email template which I have hard coded in the class something like -\n\n\tStringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer(form.getSenderName());\n\tbuf.append(\" want to look at this page: \").append(\"\\n\\n<\");\n\tbuf.append(\"http://\").append(host).append(form.getPageUrl()).append(\">\\n\\n\");\n\tbuf.append(\"Please click on the link above for more information.\");\n\tbuf.append(\"\\n\\n\");\n\t\n\nBut, the email templates can be changed frequently as per business. Can I utilize spring for this purpose (or any other way), so that I don't have to the Java code again and again.    ",
