  "body": "\n\nI am getting the following exception:\n\n> \"Nullable object must have a value\"\n\nEverything was working when I was using \n\n`StartupURI=\"MainWindow.xaml`\"\n\nbut I wanted to implement a login screen so I changed this to\n\n\tStartup=\"Application_Startup\" \n\t\n\nand then created the following method in App.xaml.cs:\n\n\t    private void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e)\n\t    {\n\t        UpdateAccounts();\n\t        bool result = true;\n\t        ///*\n\t        LoginWindow login = new LoginWindow();            \n\t        result = login.ShowDialog().Value;\n\t        /* */\n\t\n\t        if (!result)\n\t        {\n\t            return;\n\t        }\n\t\n\t        MainWindow window = new MainWindow();\n\t        bool main = window.ShowDialog().Value;\n\t    }\n\t\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what is going on? Or any suggestions on what is the best practice for implementing login interface.\n\nThe exception is being thrown at \n\n> bool main = window.ShowDialog().Value;\n\nException Stack Trace:\n\n\t   at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowInvalidOperationException(ExceptionResource resource)\n\t   at System.Nullable`1.get_Value()\n\t\n\nMy MainWindow.xaml was my default window that was being loaded when app started, and it worked prefectly fine. It has a lot of code inside it. A couple listboxes, a couple combo boxes, month calendar. It also connects to an access database.\n\nTo me it seems like my Window is return from ShowDialog() straight away, without letting me set DialogResult.\n\nUpdate: I don't get an exception if i change my code to:\n\n\t    private void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e)\n\t    {\n\t        UpdateAccounts();\n\t        bool result = true;\n\t        ///*\n\t        LoginWindow login = new LoginWindow();            \n\t        result = login.ShowDialog().Value;\n\t        /* */\n\t\n\t        if (!result)\n\t        {\n\t            return;\n\t        }\n\t\n\t        MainWindow window = new MainWindow();\n\t        window.ShowDialog();\n\t    }\n\t\n\nbut I also don't get my main window show up, and the app just closes after logging in.",
