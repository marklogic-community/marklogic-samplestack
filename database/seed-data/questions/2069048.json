PNG, JPEG, JPG, GIF?\n\nHere's what I have so far:\n\n\t    public void EncryptFile()\n\t    {            \n\t        OpenFileDialog dialog = new OpenFileDialog();\n\t        dialog.Filter = \"txt files (*.txt)|*.txt|All files (*.*)|*.*\";\n\t        dialog.InitialDirectory = @\"C:\\\";\n\t        dialog.Title = \"Please select an image file to encrypt.\";\n\t        if (dialog.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)\n\t        {\n\t            //Encrypt the selected file. I'll do this later. :)\n\t        }             \n\t    }\n\t\n\nNotice that the filter is set to .txt files. I **could** change to PNG, but what of the other types?\n\nThanks SO!\n\nEdit:\n\nI figure it out, this is how you do it:\n\n\tdialog.Filter = \"JPEG Files (*.jpeg)|*.jpeg|PNG Files (*.png)|*.png|JPG Files (*.jpg)|*.jpg|GIF Files (*.gif)|*.gif\";\n\t",
