  "body": "\n\nAre there any tools available that will let me rebase in git style an SVN branch onto a new parent?\n\nSo, in the following situation, I create a feature branch, and there are commits to the trunk\n\n\t              E---F---G  Feature\n\t             /\n\tA---B---C---D--H--I trunk\n\t\n\nI'm looking for a tool which copies the trunk, and applies the commits one by one, letting me resolve any conflicts if any exist - but each commit retains the same commit message, and is still a separate commit.\n\n\t                    E'---F'---G'  Feature\n\t                   /\n\tA---B---C---D--H--I trunk\n\t\n\nSo commit E' will be a commit with the same changes as E, except in the case of E causing a conflict, in which case E' will differ from E in that E' has the conflicts resolved, and the same commit message as E.\n\nI'm looking for this as it helps in keeping branches up to date with trunk - the svnmerge.py / mergeinfo way does not help, as you still need to resolve your changes when you merge back to trunk.",
