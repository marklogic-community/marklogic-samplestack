  "body": "\n\nI am still very new to the MVC framework, but I managed to create a controller that reads from a database and writes JSON to an url; \n\n`host.com/Controllername?minValue=something&maxValue=something`\n\nHowever when I move the site to a subfolder;\n\n`host.com/mvc/`\n\nit doesn't seem to be able to call the controller from there when I do it like this; \n\n`host.com/mvc/Controllername?minValue=something&maxValue=something`\n\nDid I forget to do something somewhere to make this url call valid from that subfolder?\nAny help here would be greatly appreciated.",
