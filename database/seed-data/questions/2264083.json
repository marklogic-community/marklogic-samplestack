  "body": "\n\nIn my application - there are four buttons named as follows.\n* Top - left\n* Bottom - left\n* Top - right\n* Bottom - right\n\nAbove this buttons there is an image view / or we can use also UIView.\n\nNow, suppose user taps on - top - left button. Above image / view should be rounded from that particular corner.\n\nI am having some difficulty in applying rounded corners to the UIView.\n\nRight now I am using following code to apply the rounded corners to each corner of view.\nHere it is.\n\n\t    // imgVUserImg is a image view on IB.\n\t    imgVUserImg.image=[UIImage imageWithData:[NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"any Url Here\"];\n\t    CALayer *l = [imgVUserImg layer];\n\t    [l setMasksToBounds:YES];\n\t    [l setCornerRadius:5.0];  \n\t    [l setBorderWidth:2.0];\n\t    [l setBorderColor:[[UIColor darkGrayColor] CGColor]];\n\t\n\nAbove code is applying the roundness to each of corners of supplied View. Instead I just wanted to apply roundness to selected corners like - top / top+left / bottom+right etc.\n\nIs it possible ? IF yes then, How?\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your knowledge.\n\nSagar.",
