  "body": "\n\nEveryone referred to it as Socket Programming or Network Programming in C and we started using it by using by including `sys/socket.h` & `netinet/in.h`. We thought it was 100% true. But question raised in my mind when I saw this book\n\n**Internetworking With TCP/IP Volume III: Client-Server Programming and Applications,** which was available in 4 different versions\n1. Linux/POSIX Sockets\n2. AT&T TLI (Transport Layer Interface) Sockets\n3. BSD (Berkeley) sockets\n4. Window Sockets\n\nI'm confused. This clearly shows that there is no standard for Socket API. \n\nalso I'm surprised to see `sys/socket.h` & `netinet/in.h` which are part of POSIX C library in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets) . I'm more confused now.\n1. Why isn't there a standard for this? \n2. What more socket APIs are available? \n3. What are the differences between each of these Socket API? \n4. When People say Just \"Network Programming in C\" / \"Socket Programming\" what exactly they are referring to?\n5. Links for any further information?",
