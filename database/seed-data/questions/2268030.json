  "body": "\n\nRight, I have a photoshop PSD file, a spreadsheet filled with custom data and a folder full of images. I want a way to create a unique image for each entry in the spreadsheet, where the spread sheet contains data that must populate text elements in the PSD, and references an image which needs to be pasted in to photoshop.\n\nI would normally do this manually, but I need it done for 400+ images, so I am analyzing ways I can automate this, scripted or otherwise.\n\nDo you guys have any ideas? I am desperate!",
