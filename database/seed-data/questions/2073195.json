  "body": "\n\n`myRainfallDB` is a three-dimensional array containing information about the rainfall in random places on earth. I want to set up the following array structure:\n\n`myRainfallDB[]` contains a list of place records. These coordinates must be stored in doubles.\n\n`myRainfallDB[][]` contains\n* At index 0: a double containing the X coordinate of the place\n* At index 1: a double containing the Y coordinate of the place\n* At index 2: an array containing twelve doubles storing the amount of rainfall every month\n\nI know I could probably get things done more efficiently by using classes, but I'm just learning C so I only want to toy with arrays for now. How would I go about declaring this 3D array?",
