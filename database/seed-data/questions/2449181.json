  "body": "\n\nI am trying to make my web app compatible with international languages and I am stuck with trying to convert escaped characters in my Delphi .NET DLL. \n\nThe front end code is passing the UTF-8 hex notation with an escape character e.g  for お I pass \\uE3818A. In my DLL I capture this and constract the following string '$E3818A'. I need to convert this back to お and send it to my database, I've been trying to use Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes and Encoding.UTF8.GetString but with no luck. \n\nAnyone could help me figure this out?\n\nThank you.",
