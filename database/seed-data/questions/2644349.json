  "body": "\n\nI have a few swf's that are loaded into a base file using levels. These clips can be cycled through by means of a setInterval function or when the user clicks the next or previous button. However, when the user hovers over a defined 'hit' area which is ultimately a blank movie clip, the setTimeout call is then canceled. This works fine, except that now the 'hit' clip - being above everything - prevents the movies below accepting hit states, and if I move it to below everything else, when one mouses over any element in the loaded movie, it then acts as though the user has mouse out of the hit area. \n\nIs there any way to have this 'hit' clip do its job simply by determining if the mouse is over it, but without using an onRollOver function or equivalent?\n\nMuch appreciated",
