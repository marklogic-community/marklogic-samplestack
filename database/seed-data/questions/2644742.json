  "body": "\n\nI'm launching an EC2 instance, by invoking [](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/index.html?ApiReference-cmd-RunInstances.html)  from simple a bash script, and want to perform further operations on that instance (e.g. associate elastic IP), for which I need the instance id.\n\nThe command is something like `ec2-run-instances ami-dd8ea5a9 -K pk.pem -C cert.pem --region eu-west-1 -t c1.medium -n 1`, and its output:\n\n\tRESERVATION r-b6ea58c1    696664755663    default\n\tINSTANCE    i-945af9e3    ami-dd8ea5b9    pending    0    c1.medium    2010-04-15T10:47:56+0000    eu-west-1a    aki-b02a01c4    ari-39c2e94d   \n\t\n\nIn this example, `i-945af9e3` is the id I'm after.\n\nSo, I'd need a simple way to parse the id from what the command returns - how would you go about doing it? My AWK is a little rusty... Feel free to use any tool available on a typical Linux box. (If there's a way to get it directly using EC2-API-tools, all the better. But afaik there's no EC2 command to e.g. return the id of the most recently launched instance.)",
