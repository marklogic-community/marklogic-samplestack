  "body": "\n\nIs there any compiler that has a directive or a parameter to cast integer calculation to float implicitly. For example:\n\n\tfloat f = (1/3)*5;\n\tcout << f;\n\t\n\nthe \"f\" is \"0\", because calculation's constants(1, 3, 10) are integer. I want to convert integer calculation with a compiler directive or parameter. I mean, I won't use explicit casting or \".f\" prefix like that:\n\n\tfloat f = ((float)1/3)*5;\n\t\n\nor\n\n\tfloat f = (1.0f/3.0f)*5.0f;\n\t\n\nDo you know any c/c++ compiler which has any parameter to do this process without explicit casting or \".f\" thing?",
