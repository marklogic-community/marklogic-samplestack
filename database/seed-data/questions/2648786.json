  "body": "\n\nMy custom controls are not loading in VS.NET's designer because of a null reference exception.  It's got everything to do with the way I am retrieving the baseUri of the application when it runs in the browser:\n\n\t_uriPrefix = Application.Current.Host.Source.AbsoluteUri.Substring(0,\n\t     Application.Current.Host.Source.AbsoluteUri.IndexOf(\"/ClientBin\")).Trim();\n\t\n\nAccording to the exception details and the help file I'm directed to ([here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/query/dev10.query?appId=Dev10IDEF1&l=EN-US&k=k%28VS.WPFDESIGNER.TROUBLESHOOTING%29%3Bk%28TargetFrameworkMoniker-%22SILVERLIGHT%2cVERSION%3dV4.0%22%29&rd=true)) I'm not correctly designing my app for a runtime that's not the browser (i.e. the new WPF editor in VS.NET or Expression Blend).  \n\nSo, the question is how do retrieve the baseUri (the [http://localhost:####](http://localhost:####) part of my application) if I can't use Application.Host which apparently is null during design time?  is there a safe way to do this so I can load my custom controls in a designer?",
