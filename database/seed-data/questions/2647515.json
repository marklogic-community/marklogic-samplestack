  "body": "\n\nI have a Button on appwidget, that I need to 'enable'/'disable' programmatically from a Service.\n\nFirst idea was to call `setBoolean(R.id.buttonid, \"setClickable\", false)` to disable it, but apparently you can't call `setClickable` remotely.\n\nAnother idea was was remove the text label from it with `rv.setTextViewText(R.id.buttonid, \"\")` and then remove the click handler by `rv.setOnClickPendingIntent(R.id.buttonid, null)`. Unfortunately passing `null` to it causes `NullPointerException` in in `android.app.ActivityThread.handleServiceArgs`\n\nIs there some other way to programmatically disable/enable appwidget Button? I could just call `rv.setViewVisibility(R.id.buttonid, View.GONE)` to hide the button completely instead of disabling it. This would however completely break whole widget layout and I would like to avoid it. \n\nThe solution I'm using now is hiding the button with `setViewVisibility` and showing other blank button instead to the keep appwidget layout as it was before.",
