  "body": "\n\nI have an ordered list (ol) on my page but the numbering is not showing up at all! I have done this:\n\n\t<ol>\n\t<li>my text</li>\n\t<li>my text</li>\n\t<li>my text</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t\n\nAs I have typed the above, stackoverflow was able to render it correctly the way I wanted it to, like so:\n1. my text\n2. my text\n3. my text\n\nHowever, this is not happening on my webpage. I am viewing this in Firefox on my localhost.\n\nIf any knows why my ol's look like ul's (i.e. no numbering) I would be grateful for help. If not, please let me know how I can achieve a numbered list using ul's.\n\nThanks all",
