There is a solution using JavaScript but this is not ideal for several reasons. Intercepting the compiler is not an option because of unnecessarily using `Response.Write` for trivial HTML.\n\nIs there something I can do with HTTP modules or the view engine?\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n**UPDATE:** I do not need to HTML encode the attributes but I do have a need to change them.\n\nCheers.",
