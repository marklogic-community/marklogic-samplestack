  "body": "\n\nI suddenly have a big problem I didn't have before. \n\nIn my current project, I want to add a reference to \"Microsoft.Office.Interop.OneNote\". When I open the .NET tab of the \"Add Reference\" dialog, the \"Microsoft.Office\" assemblies aren't available like they used to be; on my machine, the next assembly after \"Microsoft.JScript\" is called \"Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo\"; no trace of any of the \"Microsoft.Office\" assemblies. I used to be able to do this under Windows XP, but made the switch to Windows 7 a couple of weeks ago. I don't know whether that has anything to do with it.\n\nI already checked whether the assemblies are installed on my machine, but I found all of the office assemblies safe and sound in \"windows\\assembly\". Oddly enough, the reference to  \"Microsoft.Office.Interop.OneNote\" in a previous project continues to work; I just can't add any new references with the \"add references\" dialog, as they aren't shown in the list of .NET references anymore. \n\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nKind regards,\n\nRainer",
