  "body": "\n\nI am attempting to populate a table based on 2 and 3 week intervals for a semi-monthly pay period in TSQL. The table should populate,\n\n\t2 week date\n\t2 week date\n\t3 week date\n\t2 week date\n\t2 week date\n\t3 week date\n\t\n\n..based on the first date I supply, subsequently adding 2 or 3 weeks to the last date supplied.  I should be able to supply a start date and end date.  It may be that it's just early in the morning, but can't think of an elegant way to accomplish this task.  Any pointers?\n\nThanks!\nGeorge",
