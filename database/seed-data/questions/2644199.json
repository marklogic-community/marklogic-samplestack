I tried the following but it doesn't work.\n\ninclude \"myfile.php?var=123\";\n\nand in myfile.php, I try to retrieve the parameter using $_GET[\"var\"].\n\n`include \"myfile.php?var=123\";` will not work. PHP searches for a file with this exact name and does not parse the parameter\n\nfor that I also did this:\n\n`include \"http://MyGreatSite.com/myfile.php?var=123\";`but it does not also work.\n\nAny hints? Thanks.",
