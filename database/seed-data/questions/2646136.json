All the SQL credentials are correct as the connection tests succesfully and I've checked the connection string. Finally the service is running as a basicHttp Below you can see all my code so if you have any ideas as to how I can stop the error it would be appreciated.\n\n\tnamespace AnnouncementServiceLibrary\n\t{\n\t    [ServiceContract]\n\t    public interface IConnect\n\t    {\n\t        [OperationContract]\n\t        List<Mess> ConnectUser(string userId);\n\t    }\n\t}\n\t\n\tnamespace AnnouncementServiceLibrary\n\t{\n\t    public class AnnounceService : IAnnounceService\n\t    {\n\t#region IConnect Members\n\t\n\t        public List<Mess> ConnectUser(string userId)\n\t        {\n\t                List<Mess> mess = new List<Mess>();\n\t                List<Message> me;\n\t                List<MessageLink> messLink;\n\t\n\t                AnnouncementDBDataContext aDb = new AnnouncementDBDataContext();\n\t\n\t                me = aDb.Messages.ToList();\n\t                messLink = aDb.MessageLinks.ToList();\n\t\n\t                var result = (from a in messLink\n\t                              join b in me\n\t                                  on a.UniqueID equals b.UniqueID\n\t                              where a.UserID == userId\n\t                              select new { b.UniqueID, b.Author, b.Title, b.Body, b.Priority, a.Read, b.TimeRecieved }).\n\t                    DefaultIfEmpty();\n\t\n\t                foreach (var a in result)\n\t                {\n\t                    mess.Add(new Mess(a.UniqueID, a.Author, a.Title, a.Body, a.Priority, (bool)a.Read, a.TimeRecieved));\n\t                }\n\t                return mess;\n\t        }\n\t        #endregion\n\t    }\n\t}\n\t",
