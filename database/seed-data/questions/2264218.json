  "body": "\n\ni have sniffed a file upload to find out tcp segments. i see a dup ack and and fast retransmission in the ethereal output. i want to verify that the timer for retransmission of this packet is indeed the one that is indicated by jacobson's formula. i have the timestamps for all segments. what portion of my linux source should i study to find out the retransmission timer value calculation algorithm used by my system.\nif it is the same as jacobson's algorithm i want to know the value of alpha for the retransmission timer.",
