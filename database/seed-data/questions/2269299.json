I'd like to follow the example code below but I have no idea where to start. How do you edit a DNS setup? Do I need to have a dedicated virtual host to do this? Right now I have a standard (crappy) Dreamhost shared hosting. If I go with a DVH, is Media Temple a good pick?\n\nAny media recs would be helpful - my google search's have only resulted in angry customer/hosting company tirades. \n\nThanks! \n\n\t# 1) Point *.example.com in your DNS setup to your server.\n\t#\n\t# 2) Setup an Apache vhost to catch the star pointer:\n\t#\n\t# <VirtualHost *:80>\n\t#   ServerName example.com\n\t#   ServerAlias *.example.com\n\t# </VirtualHost>\n\t#\n\t# 3) Set the current account from the subdomain\n\tclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n\t  before_filter :set_current_account\n\t\n\t  private\n\t    def set_current_account\n\t      @current_account = Account.find_by_subdomain!(request.subdomains.first)\n\t    end\n\tend\n\t\n\t# 4) Tie all top-level requests off the current account\n\tclass CustomersController < ApplicationController\n\t  def index\n\t    @customers = @current_account.customers\n\t  end\n\tend\n\t",
