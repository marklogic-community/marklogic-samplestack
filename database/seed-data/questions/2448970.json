Obviously, there would be a page-refresh involved.\n\nSo, if the form had a button called 'add'...\n\nI figured I could do it like this:\n\n\tif request.method=='POST':\n\t  if 'add' in request.POST:\n\t    PrimaryFunctionFormSet = inlineformset_factory(Position,Function,extra=1)\n\t    prims = PrimaryFunctionFormSet(request.POST)\n\t\n\nWhich I thought would add 1 each time, then populate the form with the post data. However, it seems that the extra=1 does not add 1 to the post data.",
