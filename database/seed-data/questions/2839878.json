  "body": "\n\nI have a file that contains java serialized objects like \"Vector\". I have stored this file over Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS). Now I intend to read this file (using method readObject) in one of the map task. I suppose \n\n\tFileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(\"hdfs/path/to/file\");\n\t\n\nwont' work as the file is stored over HDFS. So I thought of using org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem class. But Unfortunately it does not have any method that returns FileInputStream. All it has is a method that returns FSDataInputStream but I want a inputstream that can read serialized java objects like vector from a file rather than just primitive data types that FSDataInputStream would do.\n\nPlease help!
