  "body": "\n\nAre there any C/C++ open source audio encoder besides LAME MP3? It doesn't need to be exactly mp3 format, I need a \"compressed digital audio file\".\n\nI do not want to use Lame because it is too big while no programmer can answer a [simple question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2419928/where-to-get-pure-c-lame-mp3-encoder-pcm-to-mp3-example) on it (share simple but easily downloadable and readable project containing only needed 2 simple functions... So I'm tired of searching for help with it.. I need something fresh powerful but more readable than [this lib I found (mp3stego)](http://www.petitcolas.net/fabien/steganography/mp3stego/) )\n\n\"I  don't want LAME because I am a fighter with its monopoly\" Haha..
