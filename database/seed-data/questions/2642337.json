What I get is:\n\n<pre>\n(defun swank-clojure-decygwinify (path)\n  \"Convert path from CYGWIN UNIX style to Windows style\"\n  (if (swank-clojure-cygwin)\n      (replace-regexp-in-string \"\\n\" \"\" (shell-command-to-string (concat \"cygpath -w \" path)))\n    (path)))\n</pre>\n\nwhere else form is not indented at the same level as the then form. Is there an obvious way to fix this?",
