  "body": "\n\nWhat is the best way to generate soap xml in c#?  I prefer to use xml-serialization if possible.  Also, I need to add some custom attributes to the soap header, so not sure if this complicates things.\n\nOne more note:  I'm connecting to a soap server on a linux server over TCP - the soap server was built in C++. \n\nAlso, the soap server does not respond to wsdl requests - it's fully locked down.  Security is extremely tight where I work... :)",
