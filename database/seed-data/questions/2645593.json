  "body": "\n\nI have an Email column with invalid  addresses in them e.g. “xxx@hotmail.co.uk,xxx@hotmail.co.uk”. (It includes the quotes)\n\nMy select statement cleans these up:\n\n\tSELECT SUBSTRING([Email], 2, PATINDEX(‘%,%’, [Email] – 2))\n\tFROM table\n\tWHERE [Email] LIKE ‘”%”’\n\t\n\nThis works and displays: xxx@hotmail.co.uk\n\nProblem I have is, I have a multitude of records with the incorrect format and I need to update them with the result from the SELECT query above.  Any ideas?",
