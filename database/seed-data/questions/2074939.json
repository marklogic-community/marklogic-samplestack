  "body": "\n\nI have a working mapview application in which I can hit a service and show GPoints on the map as overlay.\n\nWhat I want to do next is show an encoded Gpolyline as an overlay on my mapView.\nWhen I try to instantiate a GPolyline poline object in my main activity, eclipse doesnt recognize the class. Is there a library import I am missing?\n\nA quick example of adding a GPolyline to the mapView in an android application will be a great help.\n\nThanks,\nPrachi Gupta",
