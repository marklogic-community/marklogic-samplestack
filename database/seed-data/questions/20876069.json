Most everything I've looked at is linux based and difficult to separate linux paths from config paths.\n\nEdit2: Things are on hold at the moment. I updated Android Studio and that killed everything because it comes with gradle 1.9 dependancies but doesn't install gradle 1.9 properly. So I thought I'd download the full installer with gradle 1.9 but the download link gives me the version I started with. I know. I should have known better than to update but given the issues I thought it might actually contain a fix.\n\nEdit3: Problem solved. I have a full answer typed up ready to post but SO won't let me post it until tomorrow.", "lastActivityDate":"2014-01-04T21:55:41.627", "title":"Using Android Studio how do I get a signed, non-debug and zip aligned APK?", "tags":["android", "android-studio", "apk", "android-gradle"], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201401", "itemTally":0, "owner":{"displayName":"m12lrpv", "id":"3103269"}}
