  "body": "\n\nall. I'm having a bit of weird problem with client server program. I have two different kinds of clients trying to connect to one server, one is just more barebone than the other with less things to do. But other wise they are practically the same. While the barebone code can connect to server and server accepts it fine, the elaborate version of it can't. The client says it's connected, sends messages (via both send() and sendto()) and gets number of bytes sent back. But the server doesn't recognize it. I'm not really sure why, esp upon comparing both versions of clients, they are really the same thing (at least until connect() is called), elaborate version has bind() whereas barebone version doesn't. Can anybody see a problem as to why these very similar codes don't work similar :P\n\n\t    if (argc == 3)\n\t{\n\t    host = argv[1];         // server address\n\t    info.c_name = argv[2];\n\t}\n\telse\n\t{\n\t    printf(\"plz read the manual, kthxbai\\n\");\n\t    exit(1);\n\t}\n\t\n\thp = gethostbyname(host);\n\tif (!hp)\n\t    exit(1);\n\tprintf(\"host found\\n\");\n\t\n\t// setting up address and port structure information\n\tbzero((char * ) &server_address, sizeof(server_address));\n\tserver_address.sin_family = AF_INET;\n\tserver_address.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);\n\tserver_address.sin_port = htons(SERVER_PORT);\n\t\n\t\n\t// opening up socket\n\tsockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);\n\tif (sockfd < 0)\n\t    exit(1);\n\telse\n\t    printf(\"socket is opened: %i \\n\", sockfd);\n\tinfo.sock_fd = sockfd;\n\t\n\t\n\t// binding socket to a port: not in barebone version\n\trv = bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *) &server_address, sizeof(server_address));\n\tif (rv < 0)\n\t{\n\t    printf(\"MAIN: ERROR bind() %s\\n\", strerror(errno));\n\t    exit(1);\n\t}\n\telse\n\t    printf(\"socket is bound\\n\");\n\t\n\t// connecting\n\trv = connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *) &server_address, sizeof(server_address));\n\tprintf(\"rv = %i\\n\", rv);\n\tif (rv < 0)\n\t{\n\t    printf(\"MAIN: ERROR connect() %i:  %s\\n\", errno, strerror(errno));\n\t    exit(1);\n\t}\n\telse\n\t    printf(\"connected\\n\");\n\t\n\nI'm not even sure where the problem is, whether it's the elaborate version of client or it's just the server?
