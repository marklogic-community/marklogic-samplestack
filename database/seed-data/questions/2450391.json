  "body": "\n\nWe recently attempted a large, \"cherry picked\" merge. First we did a full merge from one child development branch into the parent Main branch, then did a full merge of the Main branch into another child development branch, then we attempted to do a cherry pick merge from the second Development branch back into merge. There were many checkins, including renames and deletes; and when it wasn't working we did a bunch of TFPT rollbacks.\n\nWhat options do we have to recover here? Things like baseless, force, etc merge? Roll back to a point in time and somehow, try again?",
