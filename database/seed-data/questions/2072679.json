  "body": "\n\nMy query currently is:\n\n\tSELECT x, MAX(z) AS mz, y FROM my_table GROUP BY x\n\t\n\nThe columns x and mz are returned as expected, but the last column, y, does not match up with the other two. In other words, I want the \"y\" column to match the mz column just like the x column currently does. How do I pull that off?\n\nUPDATE: Sorry, the question wasn't very clear. I want to perform the following query: \n\n> SELECT * FROM (SELECT x, MAX(z) AS\n  mz FROM my_table GROUP BY x) a RIGHT\n  JOIN (SELECT y, MAX(z) AS mz FROM\n  my_table GROUP BY y) b ON a.mz =\n  b.mz\n\nwithout having to use 3 SELECT statements (Perhaps that's not a big deal, but it seems like an inefficient query to me. But I'm pretty new at sql queries, so I dunno.)\n\nUPDATE #2: Lets say my table looks like this:\n\n\t-------------------\n\t|  x  |  y  |  z  |\n\t-------------------\n\t| 45  |  h  |  3  |\n\t| 23  |  c  |  5  |\n\t| 45  |  e  |  9  |\n\t| 23  |  b  |  12 |\n\t| 45  |  x  |  36 |\n\t| 33  |  s  |  44 |\n\t| 33  |  p  |  78 |\n\t-------------------\n\t\n\nI want to return the following:\n\n\t-------------------\n\t|  x  |  y  |  z  |\n\t-------------------\n\t| 23  |  b  |  12 |\n\t| 45  |  x  |  36 |\n\t| 33  |  p  |  78 |\n\t-------------------\n\t",
