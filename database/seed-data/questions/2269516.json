  "body": "\n\nI am trying to localize everything to a namespace in javascript.  So I have objects that follow a naming convention like:\n\nmyapp.utilities.file.spinner\n\netc...\n\nMy question is, is there a way to avoid repeating that big string everytime I want to augment the object with a property or a method.  Currently my code looks like this...\n\n\tmyapp.utilities.file.spinner.method1 = function() { };\n\tmyapp.utilities.file.spinner.method2 = function() { };\n\tetc.\n\t\n\nSomething like this...\n\n\tspinnerPath.method1 = function()\n\t\n\n...where `spinnerPath` stands for `myapp.utilities.file.spinner`, would be nicer.  But from my understanding I cannot just say \n\n\tspinnerPath = myapp.utilities.file.spinner\n\t\n\nas that will create another object in the global space.\n\nThanks",
