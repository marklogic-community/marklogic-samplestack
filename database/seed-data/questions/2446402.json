  "body": "\n\nI'm getting a missing template error after I try rendering a partial from a plugin.  I have included the files with the following:\n\n\t%w{ models controllers helpers views }.each do  |dir| \n\t  path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'app', dir) \n\t   $LOAD_PATH << path \n\t   ActiveSupport::Dependencies.load_paths << path \n\t   ActiveSupport::Dependencies.load_once_paths.delete(path) \n\t  end \n\t\n\nThe Models are getting loaded, but as for other things I'm not sure what's going on. The helpers are not getting loaded too because I just copied the contents of the partial from the plugin instead of the render :partial => and then it came up with a helper error.\n\nQuestion is how to be able to :render :partial => from the views folder in my plugin",
