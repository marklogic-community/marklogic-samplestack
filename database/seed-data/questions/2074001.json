  "body": "\n\nI'm working with Microchip's TCP/IP stack and the host name of my device is not being broadcasted, although I can access it using its DHCP assigned IP.  \n\nSo the question is, what is the protocol that a network device uses to broadcast its host name, so that when I see a list of devices in a network I can identify it by name?  \n\nIs it the NetBIOS name service or something else?  Thanks in advance.",
