  "body": "\n\nI have a function that adds eventhandlers to control events.  Right now I have several overloads that add events to different types of controls:\n\n\tPublic Sub AddEventHandler(Button, ButtonEvent) 'adds event handling for Button.Click\n\tpublic Sub AddEventHandler(LinkButton, ButtonEvent)'adds event handling for LinkButton.Click\n\t\n\nThe problem is I want to write a function that is more robust like:\n\n\tPublic sub AddEventHandler(Control, EventToHandle, ControlEvent)\n\t\n\nwhere\n\nEventToHandle is the parameter representing Button.Click or whatever event that Button has associated with it.\n\nAny suggestions guys?  Thanks!",
