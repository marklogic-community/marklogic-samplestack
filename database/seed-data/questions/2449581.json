  "body": "\n\nI wonder if there is a plugin that is able to save the current state of my opened windows?\n\nIn my case I work at a large system, and attend several bugs in different locations, i submit a bug to test, but lots of times some adjusts must be made.. the point is I don't remember the files i changed after a few days, so It is desirable that i can save the current state of my windows.\n\nThat feature would do pretty much the same as the auto-save state as when Aptana is closed.\n\n[http://imm.io/aMD](http://imm.io/aMD)",
