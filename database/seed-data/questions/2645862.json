  "body": "\n\nI've never been able to find a good script or plugin for sql server Management Studio (2005 and or 2008) for a very common scripting need:  specifying a few/all rows in a table and scripting their insert.  You can guess my story:  I've got some configuration data in my dev db and I need to script it for deployment to UAT and then production.\n\nI've found a few cludgy systems in the past, that were more trouble than they were worth.  I need something **free** and unobtrusive.  Once I find it I'll share it with the other 20 developers in my shop who are annoyed by this.  Aren't we all annoyed by this by the way?\n\nWhat is the best, easiest, free, way to specify a few/all rows in a table and get a script their insert? \n\n###Edit\n\nResolution:  [SSMS Tools Pack](http://www.ssmstoolspack.com/Features?f=8) rocks!  Just what I was looking for:  free, unobtrusive, simple, solid.  It's got a lot of other handy additions too that I look forward to exploring.",
