  "body": "\n\nI'm creating a Rails app, and I have a model called `User`. In this model I have a boolean value called `isagirl`. A user must specify if it is a girl or not, which is done by two radio buttons. In my model I have this:\n\n\tvalidates_presence_of :isagirl, :message => \"You must be either a Boy or a Girl. If not, please contact us.\"\n\t\n\nHowever, when I don't specify a sex, I'm seeing this:\n\n> Isagirl You must be either a Boy or a Girl.\n\nas an error message. The problem is that 'Isagirl' must not be there in the error message. How can I disable that? And no, using CSS to hide it is no option.\n\nThanks",
