  "body": "\n\nOn my site, a user gets email notifications when someone comments on their profile, or comments on their blog etc...I have made a email settings page that has checkboxes to allow the user to decide to receive emails or not. \n\nThis is what I am wrapping around the email notification code chunck for the pages that have the php mail:\n\n\t    <?php if(isset($_POST['email_toggle']) && $_POST['email_toggle'] == 'true') { if(isset($_POST['commentProfileSubmit']) && $auth) {\n\t\n\t     $query etc\n\t     $to = etc\n\t\n\t\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\nMy question is what do I put on the email settings script that has the actual check boxes to make them stay checked or unchecked once you submit your settings? Another words what do I put in the if(isset portion to implement the changes?\n\n\tif(isset($_POST['email_toggle']) && $_POST['email_toggle'] == 'true') {\n\t\n\t/* what do I put here? */\n\t\n\theader(\"Location: Profile.php?id=\" . $auth->id);\n\t mysql_query($query,$connection);\n\t\n\t/* input/check boxes and submit button */\n\t\n\t<tr>\n\t <td class=\"email_check\">\n\t  <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"email_toggle\" value=\"true\" checked=\"checked\" /> Receive email Notifications When Someone Answers A Question You've Answered\n\t </td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t <td>\n\t  <input style=\"margin:10px 0px 0px 10px;\" class=\"submit\" type=\"submit\" name=\"email_toggle\" value=\"Save Settings\" />\n\t </td>\n\t</tr>\n\t}\n\t",
