My applications feel very slow during startup and initialization, particularly when showing the initial form.\n\nMy application works with an Access (MDB) database to save data. In some forms it loads data, but the first time the application shows any given form, it takes a long time to display.\n\nI've tried using NGen to decrease the startup time, but it did not help me as expected.",
