Feature: Integration Tested

  The application is configured such that developers can author and execute
  "integration", also known as "end-to-end" tests.  We will refer to "browser
  tests" and "integration" tests.

  Browser tests execute against mock REST/MarkLogic servers such that they can
  be run and verified independent of the other tiers.  The same tests will also
  be executable in true integration tests, thus running against actual REST
  and MarkLogic servers.

  Here we are playing with Cucumber and Protractor to make sure all of the
  pieces and parts are in place.

  Scenario: a test fails
    Given a test fails
    Then I do not want to see a massive stack trace that obscures my results
