> Samplestack is a comprehensive sample application that demonstrates how to build an effective MarkLogic application.  Based on the idea of a "Question and Answer" website, Samplestack shows you how to integrate MarkLogic into a three-tier application architecture (browser, application server, and database).

## README for Version 1.0.0


This release features a middle tier for the Java Enterprise Developer, implemented using Java, Spring, and Gradle.

The project includes the following major components:
* MVC browser application implemented in [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org)
* Middle appserver tier implemented in Java/[Spring](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/)
* [MarkLogic](http://www.marklogic.com/) for the database tier
* [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) framework to drive build and configuration of the appserver and database tiers
* Unit and end-to-end tests

A [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) version of Samplestack that uses gulp automation will be coming soon.

This README covers the following topics:
* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
* [Additional Information](#additional-information)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [License](#license)

## Getting Started

To start, clone this repository. For example, run the following command:  

```
git clone https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-samplestack
```

Then, launch each of the tiers to get a feel for Samplestack's 3-tiered architecture (from the bottom-up):

1) **Database**

This version of Samplestack is intended to run with MarkLogic 8.0

2) **Middle Tier - Application Server**

You can choose to run/examine one of two middle tier application servers.  Each of these will use the same MarkLogic backend configuration and the same MVC browser application.

* [Set up the Java middle tier and database tiers with gradle](appserver/java-spring/README.md)  (Available now)
* [Set up the Node middle and database tiers with gulp](appserver/node-express/README.md) (Available in future release, under development)

3) **Browser Application**

The browser application is delivered in two forms:

* The Java middle tier hosts a pre-built version; or
* [Set up the Angular.js/Gulp development environment](browser/README.md) (Available now)

## Additional Information
For more information, see the following:
* READMEs for the [database](database/README.md), [Java appserver](appserver/java-spring/README.md), and [Angular.js browser](browser/README.md) tiers.
* [Samplestack wiki](https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-samplestack/wiki).
* [MarkLogic product documentation](http://docs.marklogic.com) for further details on MarkLogic Server and the Client APIs.
* MarkLogic [Developer Community](http://developer.marklogic.com/) site with tutorials, blogs, and more.
* Full [Documentation](http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/ref-arch) on the Reference Architecture and Samplestack.
* Take [Free MarkLogic Training](http://www.marklogic.com/services/training).
Some of the courses cover how to build Samplestack.

## Reference Architecture Introduction

Samplestack is an instantiation of MarkLogic’s Reference Architecture. It demonstrates how to structure three-tiered MarkLogic applications for production:

* MarkLogic plays the role of database in Samplestack’s three-tier architecture. Samplestack shows how to configure MarkLogic to ingest, store, and manipulate documents. With the project comes tooling and configuration files to get MarkLogic primed to expose robust search and data services.

* The middle tier brokers the data between the database and the browser-based web application, coordinates integration with additional services (LDAP), locally optimizes applicationdatabase communications, and enforces business rules. There will be two versions of Samplestack which you can explore based on your preference. One version features a Java middle tier with a Spring Framework and Gradle automation. There will also be a JavaScriptNode.js implementation with gulp automation.

* The web-based front-end is a Model-View-Controller browser application which drives workflow using the business services exposed by the middle-tier and presents the user interface. It is implemented as an Angular.js application.

## Application Overview

The sample application itself is centered around the idea of a Question and Answer site. It is a searchable, transactional, content-rich web application. Users of the application participate in the crowd-sourced knowledge community by asking questions, submitting answers, commenting, and voting. Search is a rich experience with interactive facets and parameters which enable users to narrow in on the answers they seek. The initial seed dataset is an extract of content from the popular [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) website.  Their archives are made available under [CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) and comprise the seed data for Samplestack.

Each of the features in Samplestack demonstrates an important concept for developers building on MarkLogic:

Samplestack Feature | MarkLogic Concept
------------ | -------------
Full-text Search | Indexes, query styles
User records and Question documents | Data Model for POJOs and JSON.
Users and Roles (log in, log out) | Security (authentication and authorization)
Restricted Content | Role-based Permissions
Facets | Search constraints, analytics
Ask, Answer, Comment | Document updates
Voting | Updates impact sorting
Accepted Answers and Reputation | Transactional model, data integrity
