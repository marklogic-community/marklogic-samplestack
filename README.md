# marklogic-samplestack

README for Version 1.0.0-ea2

A complete application that demonstrates using MarkLogic in a three-tier application architecture.

The application implements a "Question and Answer" Scenario.

This repository contains two implementations of the application, 

* One is for the Java Enterprise Developer, and implemented using Java, Spring, and Gradle.
* One is for the JavaScript developer, and implemented using JavaScript, node.js and Gulp.

These two applications share the same view of the three application tiers.

## Usage

# For either Stack
 
* install MarkLogic and start it  http://ea.marklogic.com/download
* ``git clone https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-samplestack.git``

# Java/Spring implementation

* ```cd appserver/java-spring```
* gradlew appserver

See README.md in appserver/java-spring for further information on the samplestack-java


# JavaScript/Node implementation

* **install node/npm**
* `npm install -g bower`
* `npm install -g gulp`
* `cd browser`
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

*(in a separate terminal session...)*

* `cd browser`
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

# marklogic-samplestack-angular

* npm update
* bower update
* gulp <command>

<command> may be `build`, `unit`, `watch`.

In watch mode, you may use these URLs:

[https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) -- view the running app.
Livereload is enabled by a script embedded in the app so changes should
be instantly seen in a browser.

[https://localhost:3001/unit-runner.html](https://localhost:3001/unit-runner.html) -- run
unit tests within the browser.  Unit tests are run upon build and upon changes
during watch mode using PhantomJS and results are reported in the console.
It may also be useful to run the tests from within the browser to debug.
